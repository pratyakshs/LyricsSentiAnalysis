shine on me sunshine
walk with me world it is a skippidy doo da day
i am the happiest girl in the whole usa

good morning mornin hello sunshine
wake up sleepy head
why would you move that bojangle clock
so far away from the bed

just one more minute that why we moved it
one more hug or two
do you love wakin up next to me
as much as i love wakin up next to you

you make the coffee i will make the bed
i will fix your lunch and you will fix mine
now tell me the truth do these old shoes look funny
honey it is almost nine

now you be careful got to go
i love you have a beautiful day
and kiss the happiest girl in the whole usa

skippidy doo da thank you lord for makin him for me
and thank you for letting life turn out the way
that i always thought it could be

there once was a time that i could not imagine
how it would feel to say
i am the happiest girl in the whole usa

now shine on me sunshine
walk with me world it is a skippidy doo da day
i am the happiest girl in the whole usa

shine on me sunshine
walk with me world it is a skippidy doo da day
i am the happiest girl in the whole usa

shine on me sunshine
walk with me world it is a skippidy doo da day
i am the happiest girl in the whole usa
