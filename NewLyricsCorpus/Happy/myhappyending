oh oh oh oh oh oh
so much for my happy ending

oh oh oh oh oh oh

let talk this over
it not like we are dead
was it something i did
was it something you said
don not leave me hanging
in a city so dead
held up so high
on such a breakable thread breakable thread

    you were all the things i thought i knew
    and i thought we could be


    you were everything everything that i wanted that i wanted
    we were meant to be supposed to be but we lost it we lost it
    and all of the memories so close to me just fade away
    all this time you were pretending
    so much for my happy ending

    oh oh oh oh oh oh
    so much for my happy ending
    oh oh oh oh oh oh

    you have got your dumb friends
    i know what they say they say
    they tell you i am difficult
    but so are they but so are they
    but they don not know me
    do they even know you even know you
    all the things you hide from me
    all the shit that you do all the shit that you do
    all the stuff that you do all the stuff that you do 

    you were all the things i thought i knew
    and i thought we could be

   
    it is nice to know that you were there
    thanks for acting like you cared
    and making me feel like i was the only one
    it is nice to know we had it all
    thanks for watching as i fall
    and letting me know we were done

       he was everything everything that i wanted
    we were meant to be supposed to be but we lost it
    and all of the memories so close to me just fade away
    all this time you were pretending
    so much for my happy ending

       you were everything everything that i wanted that i wanted
    we were meant to be supposed to be but we lost it
    and all of the memories so close to me just fade away
    all this time you were pretending
    so much for my happy ending

       oh oh oh oh oh oh
    so much for my happy ending

    oh oh oh oh oh oh
