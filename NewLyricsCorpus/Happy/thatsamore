in napoli where love is king
 when boy meets girl here what they say

when the moon hits you eye like a big pizza pie
that amore
when the world seems to shine like you have had too much wine
that amore
bells will ring tingalingaling tingalingaling
and you will sing vita bella
hearts will play tippytippytay tippytippytay
like a gay tarantella

when the stars make you drool just like a pasta fazool
that amore
when you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
you are in love
when you walk down in a dream but you know you are not
dreaming signore
scuzza me but you see back in old napoli
that amore
