everybody wants to be a cat
          because a cat the only cat
          who knows where it is at
          everybody pickin up on that feline beat
          cause everything else is obsolete
          now a square with a horn
          can make you wish you weren not born
          evertime he plays
and with a square in the act
    he can set music back
    to the caveman days
    i have heard some corny birds who tried to sing
    but a cat the only cat
    who knows how to swing
    who wants to dig
    a longhaired gig
    or stuff like that
    when everybody wants to be a cat
    a square with that horn
    makes you wish you weren not born
    evertime he plays
and with a square in the act
    he is gonna set this music back
    to the stone age days
    everybody wants to be a cat
    because a cat the only cat
    who knows where it is at
    while playin jazz you always has a welcome mat
    cause everybody digs a swingin cat
    everybody digs a swingin cat
