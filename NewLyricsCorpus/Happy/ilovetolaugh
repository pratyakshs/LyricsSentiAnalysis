i love to laugh
loud and long and clear
i love to laugh
it getting worse every year
the more i laugh
the more i fill with glee
and the more the glee
the more i am a merrier me
it embarrassing
the more i am a merrier me

mary poppins
some people laugh through their noses
    sounding something like this
mmmdreadful
    some people laugh through their teeth goodness sake
    hissing and fizzing like snakes
not at all attractive to my way of thinking

    bert
    some laugh too fast
    some only blast
    others they twitter like birds
    then there the kind what can not make up their mind

    uncle albert
    when things strike me as funny
    i can not hide it inside and squeak
    as the squeakelers do
    i have got to let go with a hohohoho
    and a hahaha too

    albert and bert
    we love to laugh
    loud and long and clear
    we love to laugh
    so everybody can hear
    the more you laugh
    the more you fill with glee
    and the more the glee
    the more we are a merrier we
