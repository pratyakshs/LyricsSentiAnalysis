evening shadows make me blue
when each weary day is through
how i long to be with you my happiness

every day i reminisce
dreaming of your tender kiss
always thinking how i miss my happiness

a million years it seems
have gone by since we shared our dreams
but i will hold you again
there will be no blue memories then

whether skies are gray or blue
any place on earth will do
just as long as i am with you my happiness

whether skies are gray or blue
any place on earth will do
just as long as i am with you my happiness
