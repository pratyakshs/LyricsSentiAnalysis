somewhere over the rainbow
way up high
and the dreams that you dreamed of
once in a lullaby

somewhere over the rainbow
blue birds fly
and the dreams that you dreamed of
dreams really do come true ooh oh

someday i will wish upon a star
wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where trouble melts like lemon drops
high above the chimney tops
that where you will find me

oh somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
and the dream that you dare to
    oh why oh why can not i

    well i see trees of green and red roses too
    i will watch them bloom for me and you
    and i think to myself
    what a wonderful world

    well i see skies of blue
    and i see clouds of white
    and the brightness of day
    i like the dark
    and i think to myself
    what a wonderful world

    the colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
    are also on the faces of people passing by
    i see friends shaking hands
    saying how do you do
    they are really saying ii love you

    i hear babies cry and i watch them grow
    they will learn much more than we will know
    and i think to myself
    what a wonderful world world

    someday i will wish upon a star
    wake up where the clouds are far behind me
    where trouble melts like lemon drops
    high above the chimney top
    that where you will find me

    oh somewhere over the rainbow way up high
    and the dream that you dare to why oh why can not i i
