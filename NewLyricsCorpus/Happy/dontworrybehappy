here a little song i wrote
you might want to sing it note for note
don not worry be happy
in every life we have some trouble
when you worry you make it double
don not worry be happy

ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
don not worry
    ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
be happy
    ooh ooooh ooooh
    ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
    don not worry
    ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
be happy
    ooh ooooh ooooh
    don not worry be happy

    is not got no place to lay your head
    somebody came and took your bed
    don not worry be happy
    the land lord say your rent is late
    he may have to litigate
    don not worry be happy
look at me i am happy

    ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
    don not worry
    ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh

    ooh ooooh ooooh

    ooh ooh ooh ooh ooooh ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh
    don not worry
    ooh ooooh ooh ooh ooooh

    is not got no cash is not got no style
    is not got no girl to make you smile
    but don not worry be happy
    cause when you worry
    your face will frown
    and that will bring everybody down
    so don not worry be happy
