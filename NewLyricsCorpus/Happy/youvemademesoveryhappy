i lost at love before
got mad and closed the door
but you said try just once more

i chose you for the one
now we are having so much fun
you treated me so kind
i am about to lose my mind
you made me so very happy
i am so glad you came into my life

the others were untrue
but when it came to loving you
i would spend my whole life with you

cause you came and you took control
you touched my very soul
you always showed me that
loving you is where it is at
you made me so very happy
i am so glad you came into my life
thank you babe

i love you so much you see
you are even in my dreams
i can hear you

i am so in love with you
all i ever want to do is
thank you babe thank you babe


you made me so very happy
i am so glad you came into my life
you made me so very happy
you made me so so so very happy babe
i am so glad you came
into my life

i want to thank you girl
every day of my life
i want to thank you
you made me so very happy
