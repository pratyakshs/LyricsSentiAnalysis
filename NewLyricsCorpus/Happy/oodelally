robin hood and little john
walkin through the forest
laughin back and forth
at what the otherne has to say
reminiscin thisnthattin
havin such a good time
oodelally oodelally
golly what a day
never ever thinkin there was danger in the water
they were drinkin they just guzzled it down
never dreamin that a schemin sherrif and his posse
was awatchin them an gatherin around
robin hood and little john
runnin through the forest
jumpin fences dodgin trees
an tryin to get away
contemplatin nothin
but escape an finlly makin it
oodelally oodelally
golly what a day
oodelally oodelally
golly what a day
