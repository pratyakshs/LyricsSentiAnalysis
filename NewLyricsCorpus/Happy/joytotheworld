joy to the world the lord is come
let earth receive her king
let every heart prepare his room
and heaven and nature sing
and heaven and nature sing
and heaven and heaven and nature sing

joy to the world the savior reigns
let men their songs employ
while fields and floods
rocks hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy
repeat the sounding joy
repeat repeat the sound joy

no more let sin and sorrow grow
nor thorns infest the ground
he comes to make
his blessings flow
far as the curse is found
far as the curse is found
far as far as the curse is found

he rules the world with truth and grace
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
and wonders of his love
and wonders of is love
and wonders and wonders of his love
