if i was the sun way up there
i would go with love most everywhere
i will be the moon when the sun goes down
just to let you know that i am still around

that how strong my love is whoa
that how strong my love is
that how strong my love is baby baby
that how strong my love is

i will be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
and you can go swimming when you are here
and i will be the rainbow after the tears are gone
wrap you in my colors and keep you warm

that how strong my love is darling
that how strong my love is baby
that how strong my love is whoa
that how strong my love is

i will be the ocean so deep and wide
and get all the tears whenever you cry
i will be the breeze after the storm is gone
to dry your eyes and love you warm oh

that how strong my love is baby
that how strong my love is
that how strong my love is darling
that how strong my love is again now

that how strong my love is so deep in
well that how strong my love is
so much to love yes so much of love oh
yes so much love yes so much love
anything that hard to do i would be good for you
any kind of love you want i will be with you
