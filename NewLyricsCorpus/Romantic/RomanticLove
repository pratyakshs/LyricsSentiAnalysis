it’s really strange how did you notice everything
the words i want to hear and my everything that i want to do oh ~
as if you came into my mind secretly
you show up in front of me though i only think of you

i pinch my cheek because i’m not sure if it’s a dream
but you’re in front of me smiling so brightly

my romantic guy my heart flutters i fell in love with you
i haven’t felt such thing before you talk to me with smile
my romantic love you’re better than expected
your dazzling smile wakes me up pitapat even on the tiring days

i’ll have you i hope there’s only me who haves you
this thrilling feeling i think of that dizzy day oh와
i burst out laughing again and again although i’m watching a sad movie
what kind of spells did you cast

i feel like one day is too short because of you
time might get jealous you’re romantic my love

my romantic guy my heart flutters i fell in love with you
i haven’t felt such thing before you talk to me with smile
my romantic love you’re better than expected
your dazzling smile wakes me up pitapat even on the tiring days

i don’t want to miss this dreamlike time
god gave you

i’ll get stuck in your arms
take my love

yes i love you i love you you already know my mind
i say to you shouting because i’m not sure if you talk to me first
that i love you i love you more the words ringing in my ear
what planet are you on i’m so thankful to the planet because it sent you to me
