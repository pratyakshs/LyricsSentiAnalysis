clap your hands ya’ll it’s alright
if tomorrow is judgement day sing mommy
and i’m standing on the front line
and the lord asks me what i did with my life
i will say i spent it with you it’s alright
if i wake up in world war three world war world war three
i see destruction and poverty oh my my my
and i feel like i wanna go home
it’s okay if you’re coming with me it’s alright 

your love is my love and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
the chains of amistad couldn’t hold us
your love is my love and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
the chains of amistad couldn not hold us

if i lose my fame and fortune
it really don’t matter
and my home is on the streets 
on the streets oh lord
and i’m sleeping in grand central station okay
it’s okay if you’re sleeping with me
as the years they pass us by 
the years the years the years
we stay young through each other’s eyes 
each other’s eyes
and no matter how old we get oh
it’s okay as long as i got you baby

your love is my love and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
the chains of amistad couldn not hold us
your love is my love and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
the chains of amistad couldn not hold us

if i should die this very day
don’t cry cause on earth 
we wasn’t meant to stay
and no matter what the people say
i’ll be waiting for you 
after the judgement day

your love is my love and my love is your love
it would take an eternity to break us
the chains of amistad couldn not hold us
