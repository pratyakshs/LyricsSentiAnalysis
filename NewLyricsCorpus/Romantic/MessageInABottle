just a castaway
an island lost at sea
another lonely day
with no one here but me
more loneliness
than any man could bear
rescue me before i fall into despair

i will send an sos to the world
i will send an sos to the world
i hope that someone gets my
message in a bottle

a year has passed since i wrote my note
but i should have known this right from the start
only hope can keep me together
love can mend your life
but love can break your heart

i will send an sos to the world
i will send an sos to the world
i hope that someone gets my
message in a bottle

walked out this morning
don not believe what i saw
a hundred billion bottles
washed up on the shore
seems i am not alone at being alone
a hundred billion casatways
looking for a home

i will send an sos to the world
i will send an sos to the world
i hope that someone gets my
message in a bottle
sending out an sos
