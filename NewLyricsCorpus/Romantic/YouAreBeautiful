my life is brilliant
my love is pure
i saw an angel
of that i am sure
she smiled at me on the subway
she was with another man
but i won not lose no sleep on that
cause i have got a plan

you are beautiful
you are beautiful
you are beautiful it is true
i saw your face in a crowded place
and i don not know what to do
cause i will never be with you

yeah she caught my eye
as we walked on by
she could see from my face that i was
flying high
and i don not think that i will see her again
but we shared a moment that will last till the end

you are beautiful
you are beautiful
you are beautiful it is true
i saw your face in a crowded place
and i don not know what to do
cause i will never be with you

you are beautiful
you are beautiful
you are beautiful it is true
there must be an angel with a smile on her face
when she thought up that i should be with you
but it is time to face the truth
i will never be with you
