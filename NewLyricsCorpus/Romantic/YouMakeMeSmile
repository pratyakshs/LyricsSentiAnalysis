you make me smile
even the times i am trying to be serious
you are possessing the quality mysterious
a special style
you you you you make me smile

you make me smile
even the times our future looking gloomier
come through the door and then the room looks roomier
and for a while
you you you you make me smile

you make me smile
that how i feel boy
whenever i am with you

you make me smile
we are never thinking that it could be so possible
now on the other hand it is finally probable
i will stay a while
cause you you you you make me smile

you make me smile
that how i feel boy
whenever i am with you
you make me smile
that what you do to me baby

all the things i seem to feel uptight about
ain not so devasting after all
this must be what life is all about
standing tall each time you take a fall

you you you make me smile
that how i feel boy
whenever i am with you
you make me smile
that what you do to me baby

you make me smile
that how i feel boy
whenever i am with you
