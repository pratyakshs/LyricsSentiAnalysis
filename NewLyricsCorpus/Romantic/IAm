i am an angel i am a devil 
i am sometimes in between
i am as bad it can get
and good as it can be
sometimes i am a million colors
sometimes i am black and white
i am all extremes
try figure me out you never can
there so many things i am

i am special
i am beautiful
i am wonderful
i am powerful
unstoppable
sometimes i am miserable
sometimes i am pitiful
but that so typical of all the things i am

i am someone filled with self belief
i am haunted by self doubt
i have got all the answers
i have got nothing figured out
i like to be by myself 
i hate to be alone
i am up and i am down
but that part of the thrill 
part of the plan
part of all of the things i am

i am special
i am beautiful
i am wonderful
i am powerful
unstoppable
sometimes i am miserable
sometimes i am pitiful
but that so typical of all the things i am

i am a million contradictions
sometimes i make no sense
sometimes i am perfect 
sometimes i am a mess
sometimes i am not sure who i am

i am special
i am beautiful
i am wonderful
and powerful
unstoppable
sometimes i am miserable
sometimes i am pitiful
but that so typical of all the things i am

i am special
i am beautiful
i am wonderful
i am powerful
unstoppable
sometimes i am miserable
sometimes i am pitiful
but that so typical of all the things i am
of all the things i am
sometimes i am miserable
sometimes i am pitiful
but that so typical of all the things i am
of all the things i am
