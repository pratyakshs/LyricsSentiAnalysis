crashed on the floor when i moved in 
this little bungalow with some strange new friends
stay up too late and i am too thin 
we promise each other it is till the end 
now we are spinning empty bottles 
it the five of us 
with pretty eyed boys girls die to trust
i can not resist the day 
no i can not resist the day 

jenny screams out and it is no pose
cause when she dances she goes and goes
beer through the nose on an inside joke 
i am so excited i haven not spoken 
and she is so pretty and she is so sure
maybe i am more clever than a girl like her
the summer all in bloom 
the summer is ending soon 

it alright and it is nice not to be so alone
but i hold on to your secrets in white houses 

maybe i am a little bit over my head
i come undone at the things he said 
and he is so funny in his bright red shirt
we were all in love and we all got hurt 
i sneak into his car cracked leather seat 
the smell of gasoline in the summer heat 
boy we are going way too fast 
it all too sweet to last 

it alright
and i put myself in his hands
but i hold on to your secrets in white houses
love or something ignites in my veins 
and i pray it never fades in white houses 

my first time hard to explain
rush of blood oh and a little bit of pain
on a cloudy day it is more common than you think
he my first mistake 

maybe you were all faster than me
we gave each other up so easily 
these silly little wounds will never mend
i feel so far from where i have been 
so i go and i will not be back here again
i am gone as the day is fading on white houses 
i lie put my injuries all in the dust 
in my heart is the five of us 
in white houses 

and you maybe you will remember me
what i gave is yours to keep 
in white houses
