oh it is been such a long long time
looks like i get you off my mind
oh but i cant
just the thought of you
turns my whole world a misty blue

just the mention of your name
turns the flicker to a flame
i think of things we used to do
then my whole world
turns misty blue

i should forget you
heaven knows i tried but when i say
i am glad we are through
my heart knows i have lied

oh it is been such a long long time
looks like i get you off my mind
oh but i cant
just the thought of you
turns my whole world
a misty blue
