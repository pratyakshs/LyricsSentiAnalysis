i didn not hear you leave 
i wonder how am i still here 
i don not want to move a thing 
it might change my memory 
oh i am what i am 
i will do what i want 
but i can not hide 
i won not go 
i won not sleep 
i can not breathe 
until you are resting here with me 
i won not leave 
i can not hide 
i cannot be 
until you are resting here with me 
i don not want to call my friends 
they might wake me from this dream 
and i can not leave this bed 
risk forgetting all that been 
oh i am what i am 
i will do what i want
but i can not hide 
i won not go 
i won not sleep 
i can not breathe 
until you are resting here with me 
i won not leave 
i can not hide 
i cannot be 
until you are resting here with me
