i can hear her heart beat for a thousand miles
and the heaven open every time she smiles
and when i come to her that where i belong
yet i am running to her like a river song

she give me love love love love crazy love
she give me love love love love crazy love

she got a fine sense of humor when i am feeling low down
and when i come to her when the sun goes down
take away my trouble take away my grief
take away my heartache in the night like a thief

she give me love love love love crazy love
she give me love love love love crazy love

yes i need her in the daytime
yes i need her in the night
yes i want to throw my arms around her
kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

and when i am returning from so far away
she gives me some sweet lovin brighten up my day
yes it makes me righteous yes it makes me feel whole
yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul

she give me love love love love crazy love
she give me love love love love crazy love
