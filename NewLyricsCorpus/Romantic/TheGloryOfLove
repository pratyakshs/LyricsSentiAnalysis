you gotta give a little 
take a little 
and let your poor heart break a little
that the story of 
that the glory of love 

you gotta laugh a little 
cry a little
until the clouds roll by a little 
that the story of 
that the glory of love 

as long as there the two of us
we have got the world and all its charms 
and when the world is through with us 
we have got each other arms 

you gotta win a little 
lose a little 
yes and always have the blues a little 
that the story of 
that the glory of love 
that the story of 
that the glory of love
