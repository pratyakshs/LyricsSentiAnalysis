eightenn years have come and gone 
for momma they flew by 
but for me they just drug on 
we were loading up that chevy 
both tryin not to cry 
momma kept on talking 
putting off goodbye 
then she took my hand and said 
baby don not forget 

before you hit the highway 
you better stop for gas 
there a fifty in the ashtray 
in case you run short on cash 
here a map and here a bible 
if you ever lose your way 

just one more thing before you leave 
don not forget to remember me 
this downtown apartment sure makes me miss home 
and those bills there on the counter 
remind me i am on my own 
and just like every sunday i called momma up last night 
and even when it is not i tell her everything alright 
before we hung up i said 
hey momma don not forget to tell my baby sister i will see her in the fall 
and tell memall that i miss her 
yeah i should give her a call 
and make sure you tell daddy that i am still his little girl 
yeah i still feel like i am where i am supposed to be 
don not forget to remember me 

tonight i find myself kneeling by the bed to pray 
i haven not done this in a while 
so i don not know what to say but 
lord i feel so small some times in this big ol place 
i know there are more important things but 
don not forget to remember me 
don not forget to remember me
