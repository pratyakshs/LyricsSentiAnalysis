now i will tell you what i have done for you
fifty thousand tears i have cried
screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
and you still won not hear me
iâ€™m going under
don not want your hand this time i will save myself
maybe i will wake up for once
not tormented daily defeated by you
just when i thought i would reached the bottom
i am dying again

i am going under
drowning in you
i am falling forever
i have got to break through
i am going under

blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
so i don not know what real and what not
always confusing the thoughts in my head
so i can not trust myself anymore
i am dying again

i am going under
drowing in you
i am falling forever
i have got to break through

so go on and scream 
scream at me i am so far away
i won not be broken again
i have got to breathe i can not keep going under
