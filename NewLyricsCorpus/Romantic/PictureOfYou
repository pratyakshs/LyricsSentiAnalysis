didn not they say that i would make a mistake 
didn not they say you were gonna be trouble 
people told me you were too much to take 
i couldn not see it i didn not want to know 

i let you in and you let me down 
you messed me up and you turned my life around 
left me feeling i had nowhere to go 
i was alone how was i to know that 

you would be there when i needed somebody 
you would be there the only one could help 

i had a picture of you in my mind 
never knew it could be so wrong 
why would it take me so long just to find 
the friend that was there all along 

who would believe that after all we have been through 
i would be able to put my trust in you 
goes to show you can forgive and forget 
looking back i have no regrets cause 

you would be there when i needed somebody 
you would be there the only one could help me 

i had a picture of you in my mind 
never knew it could be so wrong 
why would it take me so long just to find 
the friend that was there all along 

you would be there when i needed somebody 
you would be there the only one could help me 

i had a picture of you in my mind 
never knew it could be so wrong

the friend that was there all along
