if you only knew 
what i have been going through 
waiting and wanting you 
could this be love 
how tell me how will i know 
will my heart make me believe it so 
or can i trust the way i feel 
if you could read my mind 
you see how hard i have tried 
still i can not decide 

if you only knew 
what i have been going through 
waiting and wanting you 
could this be love 
oh tell me could this be love 

do you know if it is true 
that real love lasts a lifetime 
does it shine like the stars up in the sky 
and do you know if you can fall for 
just a moment 
is a moment for all time 
why why am i so unsure 
is that love knocking at my door 
or the sound of my beating heart 
if you could read my mind 
you know i just can not hide 
what i feel inside 


oh tell me could this be love
