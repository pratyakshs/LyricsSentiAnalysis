love of mine some day you will die
but i will be close behind
i will follow you into the dark

no blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
just our hands clasped so tight
waiting for the hint of a spark

if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the no on their vacancy signs

if there no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i will follow you into the dark

in catholic school as vicious as roman rule
i got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
and i held my tongue as she told me
son fear is the heart of love
so i never went back

if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the no on their vacancy signs

if there no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i will follow you into the dark

you and me have seen everything to see
from bangkok to calgary
and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down

the time for sleep is now
it nothing to cry about
cause we will hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms

if heaven and hell decide
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the no on their vacancy signs

if there no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then i will follow you into the dark
then i will follow you into the dark
