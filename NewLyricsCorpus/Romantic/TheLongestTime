oh oh oh
for the longest time
oh oh oh
for the longest time

if you said goodbye to me tonight
there would still be music left to write
what else could i do 
i am so inspired by you
that hasn not happened for the longest time

once i thought my innocence was gone
now i know that happiness goes on
that when you found me 
when you put your arms around me
i haven not been there for the longest time

oh oh oh
for the longest time
oh oh oh
for the longest time

i am that voice you are hearing in the hall
and the greatest miracle of all
is how i need you 
and how you needed me too
that hasn not happened in the longest time

maybe this won not last very long
but you feel so right
and i could be wrong
maybe i have gone this far
and it is more than i would hoped for

who knows how much further we will go on
maybe i will be sorry when you are gone
i will take my chances 
i forgot how nice romance is
i haven not been there for the longest time

i had second thoughts at the start
i said to myself 
hold on to your heart
now i know the woman that you are
it wonderful so far
and you are more than i would hoped for

i don not care what consequence it brings
i have been a fool for lesser things
i want you so bad 
i think you ought to know that
i intend to hold you for the longest time
