o fortuna
velut luna o fortune
like the moon 
turn around and smell what you don not see 
close your eyes  it is so clear 
here the mirror behind there is a screen 
on both ways you can get in 
don not think twice before you listen to your heart 
follow the trace for a new start 
what you need and everything you will feel 
is just a question of the deal 
in the eye of storm you will see a lonely dove 
the experience of survival is the key 
to the gravity of love

find the one who will guide you to the limits of your choice 
but if you are in the eye of storm 
just think of the lonely dove

to the gravity of love
