there a calm surrender 
to the rush of day 
when the heat of the rolling world 
can be turned away 

an enchanted moment 
and it sees me through 
it enough for this restless warrior 
just to be with you 

and can you feel the love tonight 
it is where we are
it enough for wide eyed wanderer 
that we got this far 

and can you feel the love tonight 
how it is laid to rest 
it enough to make kings and vagabonds 
believe the very best 

there a time for evryone 
if they only learn 
that the twisting kaleidoscope 
moves us all in turn 

there a rhyme and reason 
to the wild outdoors 
when the heart of this starcrossed voyager 
beats in time with yours 

and can you feel the love tonight 
it is where we are 
it enough for this wideeyed wanderer 
that we got this far 

and can you feel the love tonight 
how it is laid to rest 
it enough to make kings and vagabonds 
believe the very best 
it enough to make kings and vagabonds 
believe the very best
