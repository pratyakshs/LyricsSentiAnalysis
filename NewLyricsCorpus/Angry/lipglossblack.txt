lip gloss and black



if i gave you pretty enough words

could you paint a picture of us that works

an emphasis on function rather than design

aren not you tired cause i will carry you on a broken back

and blown out knees i have been where you are for a while



aren not you tired of being weak

such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky

and destroy the prettiest starry night every evening that i die



i am exhumed just a little less human and a lot more bitter and cold 

i am exhumed just a little less human

a lot more bitter and cold 



after all these images of pain have cut right through you

i will kiss every scar and weep you are not alone

then i will show you that place in my chest where my heart still tries to beat it sets us apart



aren not you tired of being weak

such rage that you could scream all the stars right out of the sky

and destroy the prettiest starry night every evening that i die



live love burn die
