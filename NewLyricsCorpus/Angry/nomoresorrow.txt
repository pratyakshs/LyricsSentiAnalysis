no more sorrow



are you lost

in your lies

do you tell yourself i don not realize



your crusade a disguise

replace freedom with fear

you trade money for lives



i am aware of what you have done



no no more sorrow

i have paid for your mistakes

your time is borrowed

your time has come to be replaced



i see pain

i see need

i see liars and thieves

abuse power with greed



i had hope

i believed

but i am beginning to think that i have been deceived



you will pay for what you have done



thieves and hypocrites

thieves and hypocrites

thieves and hypocrites



your time has come to be replaced

your time has come to be erased
