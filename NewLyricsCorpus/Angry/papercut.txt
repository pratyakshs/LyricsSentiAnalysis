why does it feel like night today

something in here not right today

why am i so uptight today

paranoia all i got left

i don not know what stressed me first

or how the pressure was fed

but i know just what it feels like

to have a voice in the back of my head

like a face that i hold inside

a face that awakes when i close my eyes

a face that watches every time i lie

a face that laughs every time i fall

and watches everything



so i know that when it is time to sink or swim

that the face inside is hearing me

right beneath my skin



it like i am paranoid lookin over my back

it like a whirlwind inside of my head

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like the face inside is right beneath my skin



i know i have got a face in me

points out all my mistakes to me

you have got a face on the inside too

your paranoia probably worse

i don not know what set me off first

but i know what i can not stand

everybody acts like the fact of the matter is

i can not add up to what you can but



everybody has a face that they hold inside

a face that awakes when i close my eyes

a face that watches every time they lie

a face that laughs every time they fall

and watches everything



so you know that when it is time to sink or swim

that the face inside is watching you too

right inside your skin



it like i am paranoid lookin over my back

it like a whirlwind inside of my head

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like the face inside is right beneath my skin



the face inside is right beneath your skin



the sun goes down

i feel the light betray me

the sun goes down

i feel the light betray me



the sun

i feel the light betray me

the sun

i feel the light betray me



it like i am paranoid lookin over my back

it like a whirlwind inside of my head

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like the face inside is right beneath my skin



it like i am paranoid lookin over my back

it like a whirlwind inside of my head

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like i can not stop what i am hearing within

it like the face inside is right beneath my skin
