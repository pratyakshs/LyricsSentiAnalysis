the catalyst



god bless us everyone

we are a broken people living under loaded gun

and it can not be outfought

it can not be outdone

it can not be outmatched

it can not be outrun

no



and when i close my eyes tonight

to symphonies of blinding light



god bless us everyone

we are a broken people living under loaded gun

oh



like memories in cold decay

transmissions echoing away

far from the world of you and i

where oceans bleed into the sky



god save us everyone

will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns

for the sins of our hands

the sins of our tongues

the sins of our fathers

the sins of our young

no



and when i close my eyes tonight

to symphonies of blinding light



god save us everyone

will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns



ooh



like memories in cold decay

transmissions echoing away

far from the world of you and i

where oceans bleed into the sky



oh

like memories in cold decay

transmissions echoing away

far from the world of you and i

where oceans bleed into the sky



lift me up

let me go



god bless us everyone

we are a broken people living under loaded gun

and it can not be outfought

it can not be outdone

it can not be outmatched

it can not be outrun

no



god bless us everyone

we are a broken people living under loaded gun

and it can not be outfought

it can not be outdone

it can not be outmatched

it can not be outrun
