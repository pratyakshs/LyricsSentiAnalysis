the way i am



whatever

dre just let it run

aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit

aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it

just shut up and listen aiyyo



i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag

of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be

the most meanest mc on this  on this earth

and since birth i have been cursed with this curse to just curse

and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works

and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve

all this tension dispensing these sentences

getting this stress that been eating me recently off of this chest

and i rest again peacefully peacefully

but at least have the decency in you

to leave me alone when you freaks see me out

in the streets when i am eating or feeding my daughter

do not come and speak to me speak to me

i don not know you and no

i don not owe you a motherfucking thing

i am not mr nsync i am not what your friends think

i am not mr friendly i can be a prick

if you tick me my tank is on empty is on empty

no patience is in me and if you offend me

i am lifting you 10 feet lifting you 10 feet in the air

i don not care who was there and who saw me destroy you

go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit

i will smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe

i am tired of all you of all you

i don not mean to be mean but that all i can be is just me



and i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

radio won not even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

i don not know it is just the way i am



sometimes i just feel like my father

i hate to be bothered

with all of this nonsense it is constant

and oh it is his lyrical content 

 the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses

and all of this controversy circles me

and it seems like the media immediately

points a finger at me finger at me

so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie

or the ring or the thumb it is the one you put up

when you don not give a fuck when you won not just put up

with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too

when a dude getting bullied and shoots up his school

and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin

where were the parents at and look where it is at

middle america now it is a tragedy

now it is so sad to see an upper class city

having this happening this happening

then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way

but i am glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire

to burn and it is burning and i have returned



and i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

radio won not even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

i don not know it is just the way i am



i am so sick and tired of being admired

that i wish that i would just die or get fired

and dropped from my label let stop with the fables

i am not gonna be able to top on my name is 

and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation

that got me rotation at rocknroll stations

and i just do not got the patience got the patience

to deal with these cocky caucasians who think

i am some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk

with an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep asking

the same fucking questions fucking questions

what school did i go to what hood i grew up in

the why the who what when the where and the how

til i am grabbing my hair and i am tearing it out

cause they driving me crazy driving me crazy i can not take it

i am racing i am pacing i stand and i sit

and i am thankful for every fan that i get

but i can not take a shit in the bathroom

without someone standing by it

no i won not sign your autograph

you can call me an asshole i am glad



cause i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

radio won not even play my jam

cause i am whatever you say i am

if i wasnt then why would i say i am

in the paper the news everyday i am

i don not know it is just the way i am
