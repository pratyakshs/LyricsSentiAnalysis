i am getting used to this nuisance of fags who bad mouth this music

how fuckin stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this

you cowards cant you never will don not even try to pursue it

i took the chance i payed the bill i nearly died for this music



you make me wanna run around pulling my guns out and shit

your tempting me to run my mouth and call you out on this bitch

how ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this

you need to slit your wrist get pissed and go jump off a bridge



what you can not see the sarcasm in the verses i spit

what you think i just got lucky and didn not work for this shit

bitch i have been working at this ever since i was a kid

i played a million empty shows to only family and friends



what kind of person would dis a band that deserves to get big

i would hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kid lips

that shits as worse as it gets

this verse is over i quit

signed charlie scene on your girlfriend tits
