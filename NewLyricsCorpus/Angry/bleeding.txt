the bleeding



i remember when all the games began

remember every little lie and every last goodbye

promises you broke words you choked on

and i never walked away

it still a mystery to me



well i am so empty

i am better off without you and you are better off without me

well you are so unclean

i am better off without you and you are better off without me



the lying the bleeding the screaming

was tearing me apart

the hatred deceiving the beatings it is over



paint the mirrors black to forget you

i still picture your face and the way you used to taste

roses in a glass dead and wilted

to you this all was nothing

everything to you is nothing



well you are so filthy

i am better off without you and you are better off without me

well i am so ugly

you are better off without me and i am better off alone



the lying the bleeding the screaming

was tearing me apart

the hatred the beatings disaster it is over



as wicked as you are you are beautiful to me

you are the darkest burning star you are my perfect disease



the lying the bleeding the screaming

was tearing me apart

the hatred the beatings it is over

disaster

the lying the bleeding the screaming

was tearing me apart

the hatred the beatings it is over

disaster



it over now
