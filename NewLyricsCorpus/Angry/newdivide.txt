new divide



i remembered black skies

the lightning all around me

i remembered each flash

as time began to blur

like a startling sign

that fate had finally found me

and your voice was all i heard

that i get what i deserve



so give me reason

to prove me wrong

to wash this memory clean

let the floods cross

the distance in your eyes

give me reason

to fill this hole

connect the space between

let it be enough to reach the truth that lies

across this new divide



there was nothing in sight

but memories left abandoned

there was nowhere to hide

the ashes fell like snow

and the ground caved in

between where we were standing

and your voice was all i heard

that i get what i deserve



so give me reason

to prove me wrong

to wash this memory clean

let the floods cross

the distance in your eyes

across this new divide



in every loss in every lie

in every truth that you would deny

and each regret and each goodbye

was a mistake too great to hide

and your voice was all i heard

that i get what i deserve



so give me reason

to prove me wrong

to wash this memory clean

let the floods cross

the distance in your eyes

give me reason

to fill this hole

connect the space between

let it be enough to reach the truth that lies

across this new divide
