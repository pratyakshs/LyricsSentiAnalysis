the love that you gave me has gone with the rain
the joy that just filled me has turned into pain

my face in the mirror reminds me of you
it the one that you lied to when you said you would be true

the tears in my eyes are all that you will find
the scars on my face just deepen my mind

the love that you gave me has gone with the rain
the joy that just filled me has turned into pain
