would you know my name
if i saw you in heaven
would it be the same
if i saw you in heaven

i must be strong
and carry on
cause i know i don not belong
here in heaven

would you hold my hand
if i saw you in heaven
would you help me stand
if i saw you in heaven

i will find my way
through night and day
cause i know i just can not stay
here in heaven

time can bring you down
time can bend your knees
time can break your heart
have you begging please begging please

beyond the door
there peace i am sure
and i know there will be no more
tears in heaven

would you know my name
if i saw you in heaven
would it be the same
if i saw you in heaven

i must be strong
and carry on
cause i know i don not belong
here in heaven
