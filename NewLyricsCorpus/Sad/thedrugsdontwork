all this talk of getting old
it getting me down my love
like a cat in a bag waiting to drown
this time i am comin down

and i hope you are thinking of me
as you lay down on your side
now the drugs don not work
they just make you worse
but i know i will see your face again

now the drugs don not work
they just make you worse
but i know i will see your face again

but i know i am on a losing streak
cause i passed down my old street
and if you wanna show then just let me know
and i will sing in your ear again

now the drugs don not work
they just make you worse
but i know i will see your face again

cause baby ooh if heaven calls i am coming too
just like you said you leave my life i am better off dead
