every generation
blames the one before
and all of their frustrations
come beating on your door

i know that i am a prisoner
to all my father held so dear
i know that i am a hostage
to all his hopes and fears
i just wish i could have told him in the living years

crumpled bits of paper
filled with imperfect thought
stilted conversations
i am afraid that all we have got

you say you just don not see it
he says it is perfect sense
you just can not get agreement
in this present tense
we all talk a different language
talking in defense

say it loud say it clear
you can listen as well as you hear
it too late when we die
to admit we don not see eye to eye

so we open up a quarrel
between the present and the past
we only sacrifice the future
it the bitterness that lasts

so don not yield to the fortunes
you sometimes see as fate
it may have a new perspective
on a different date
and if you don not give up and don not give in
you may just be ok

say it loud say it clear
you can listen as well as you hear
it too late when we die
to admit we don not see eye to eye

i wasn not there that morning
when my father passed away
i didn not get to tell him
all the things i had to say

i think i caught his spirit
later that same year
i am sure i heard his echo
in my baby new born tears
i just wish i could have told him in the living years

say it loud say it clear
you can listen as well as you hear
it too late when we die
to admit we don not see eye to eye
