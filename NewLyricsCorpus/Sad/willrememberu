i will remember you
will you remember me
don not let your life pass you by
weep not for the memories

remember the good times that we had
i let them slip away from us when things got bad
how clearly i first saw you smilin in the sun
wanna feel your warmth upon me i wanna be the one

i will remember you
will you remember me
don not let your life pass you by
weep not for the memories

i am so tired but i can not sleep
standin on the edge of something much too deep
it funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
we are screaming inside but we can not be heard

but i will remember you
will you remember me
don not let your life pass you by
weep not for the memories

i am so afraid to love you but more afraid to loose
clinging to a past that doesn not let me choose
once there was a darkness deep and endless night
you gave me everything you had oh you gave me light

and i will remember you
will you remember me
don not let your life pass you by
weep not for the memories

and i will remember you
will you remember me
don not let your life pass you by
weep not for the memories
weep not for the memories
