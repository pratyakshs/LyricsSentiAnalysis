something
is about to give
i can feel it coming
i think i know what it is

i am not afraid to die
i am not afraid to live
and when i am flat on my back
i hope to feel like i did

and hardness
it sets in
you need some protection
the thinner the skin

i want you to know
that you don not need me anymore
i want you to know
you don not need anyone
or anything at all

who to say where the wind will take you
who to say what it is will break you
i don not know
which way the wind will blow

who to know when the time has come around
don not want to see you cry
i know that this is not goodbye

it somewhere i can taste the salty sea
there a kite blowing out of control on the breeze
i wonder what gonna happen to you
you wonder what has happened to me

i am a man
i am not a child
a man who sees
the shadow behind your eyes

who to say where the wind will take you
who to say what it is will break you
i don not know
where the wind will blow

who to know when the time has come around
i don not want to see you cry
i know that this is not goodbye

did i waste it
not so much i couldn not taste it
life should be fragrant
rooftop to the basement

the last of the rocks stars
when hiphop drove the big cars
in the time when new media
was the big idea
what was the big idea
