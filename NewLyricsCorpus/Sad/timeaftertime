lying in my bed i hear the clock tick
and think of you
caught up in circles confusion 
is nothing new
flashback  warm nights 
almost left behind
suitcases of memories
time after 

sometimes you picture me 
i am walking too far ahead
you are calling to me i can not hear
what you have said 
then you say  go slow 
i fall behind 
the second hand unwinds

if you are lost you can look  and you will find me
time after time
if you fall i will catch you  i will be waiting 
time after time

after my picture fades and darkness has 
turned to gray
watching through windows  you are wondering
if i am ok
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time 
if you are lost

you said go slow 
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds 

if you are lost
time after time
time after time
time after time
time after time
