i am sorry you missed out when i went to school for the 1st time
and you didn not have me tell you that you were all mine
i am sorry you weren not there to take me to the mall
and you weren not there to tell me i have to stand tall
sorry you weren not the one i saw when i came home that day
or the one i would run to when i had a bad day
i am sorry you didn not hear me write these you would have been so proud
and you weren not there to lift me up on a cloud
sorry you weren not there to tell me there nothing to fear
but then again you should have been here
i am sorry you weren not the one to teach me to ride a bike
or the one who took me on my first ride
i am sorry you weren not the one who carried me on his back
that was my other daddy the one i actually had
or the one who held me tight when strength is what i lacked
i am sorry you weren not the one to hold me when i cried
or tell me i did great when i really tried
i am sorry you were never there to teach me how to cook
or there at night to read me my favorite book
i am sorry me as a daughter is what you never had
you will always be my father but you will never be my dad
