when i was sad and depressed
i needed you to be cheer me up
instead i drank till i was numb enough not to feel anything

when everyone was attacking me and putting me down making me feel so low
i needed you to be the one to defend me and be on my side
instead i endured all the cruel words and criticism the world threw at me

when i lost all my friends and had no one
i needed you to be that only friend i had left
instead i experienced what the word friendless really meant

when i was scared and frightened
i needed you to be my security blanket
instead i had to live in fear

when i was angry and full of rage
i needed you to calm me down
instead i kept it all bottled up inside

when i felt so lonely and needed someone to care
i needed you to hold me tight and never let me go
instead i grew up alone with no one to turn to

when i was hurt and in pain
i needed you to come running with you healing ways
instead i remained scarred and bruised

when i would inflict selftorture wanting to die
i needed you to stop me and tell me how important i was
instead i hid my scars and became oblivious to everyone

when i would cry myself to sleep at night
i needed you to wipe the tears away
instead i held my pillow tight while never ending tears streamed down my face

when my world was crashing down on me
i needed you to be the one i ran to
instead i locked myself in my room in complete despair

when i felt unloved
i needed you to tell me how much you loved me
instead i learned the words i love you are meaningless
