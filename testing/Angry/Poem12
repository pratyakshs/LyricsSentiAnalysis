anger fills my heart and soul
anger takes a mighty toll
anger lessens but can never leave
anger you hope to never receive
anger stays forever within
anger acts with the might of all sin
anger is deadly to all around
anger gets mad at the thought of sound
anger is the thoughts in my head
anger that’s mine all should dread
anger for me is different from you
anger you see tells me what to do
anger will sit and whisper in my ear
anger he sits and tells me all that you fear
anger…
he is here
he’s here to stay
anger is the hole
in which we lay
anger is
and anger will
always be with us
he is in me and he is in you
he can make you do
what he wants you to
anger will make you
make you cry
anger can make you
want to die
anger can make you
go insane
anger… a blood filled rain
no more anger
no more…
walk to the bright light
shining through that door…
not knowing what’s in store
but even then
anger lives on
but you… nevermore
