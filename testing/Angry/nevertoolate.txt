never too late



this world will never be

what i expected

and if i do not belong

who would have guessed it

i will not leave alone

everything that i own

to make you feel like it is not too late

it never too late



even if i say

it will be alright

still i hear you say

you want to end your life

now and again we try

to just stay alive

maybe we will turn it all around

cause it is not too late

it never too late



no one will ever see

this side reflected

and if there something wrong

who would have guessed it

and i have left alone

everything that i own

to make you feel like

it not too late

it never too late



even if i say

it will be alright

still i hear you say

you want to end your life

now and again we try

to just stay alive

maybe we will turn it all around

cause it is not too late

it never too late



the world we knew

won not come back

the time we have lost

can not get back

the life we had

won not be ours again



this world will never be

what i expected

and if i do not belong



even if i say

it will be alright

still i hear you say

you want to end your life

now and again we try

to just stay alive

maybe we will turn it all around

cause it is not too late

it never too late

maybe we will turn it all around

cause it is not too late

it never too late it never too late

it not too late

it never too lateno more sorrow



are you lost

in your lies

do you tell yourself i do not realize



your crusade a disguise

replace freedom with fear

you trade money for lives



i am aware of what you have done



chorus]

no no more sorrow

i have paid for your mistakes

your time is borrowed

your time has come to be replaced



i see pain

i see need

i see liars and thieves

abuse power with greed



i had hope

i believed

but i am beginning to think that i have been deceived



you will pay for what you have done



chorus]



thieves and hypocrites

thieves and hypocrites

thieves and hypocrites



chorus x2]



your time has come to be replaced

your time has come to be erased
