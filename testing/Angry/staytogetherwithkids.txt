stay together for the kids



it hard to wake up when the shades have been pulled shut

this house is haunted it is so pathetic it makes no sense at all

i am ripe with things to say the words rot and fall away

what stupid poem could fix this home i would read it every day



so here your holiday

hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away

it was mine so when you are dead and gone

will you remember this night twenty years now lost

it not right



their anger hurts my ears been running strong for seven years

rather then fix the problems they never solve them it makes no sense at all

i see them everyday we get along so why can not they

if this is what he wants and it is what she wants then why is there so much pain



so here your holiday

hope you enjoy it this time you gave it all away

it was mine so when you are dead and gone

will you remember this night twenty years now lost

it not right



so here your holiday

it not right

it not right

it not right

it not right
