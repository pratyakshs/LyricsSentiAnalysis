i was told i was living a lie
i was told do not bother to cry
i was told they no longer did care
i was told i love you they did not dare

i was told i am a bad role model for my sister and brother
i was told i was betrayed by my mother
i was told my mother did not love me
i was told that is why she chose to flee
i was told the love i have for my mother to hide
i was told i later picked the wrong side

i was told the abuse i got was tough love
i was told that while getting a shove
i was told i brought them to shame
i was told i was many horrible names

i was told i was not the daughter they had in mind
i was told the love for me they could not find
i was told i was expected to fall
i was told they would not help when they received that call

i was told i was going nowhere
i was told to stay far from there
i was told i would not make much of my life
i was told she would be the one to cut with a knife
i was told they would leave me alone
i was told i was a daughter disowned
daddy no longer wants his little girl
