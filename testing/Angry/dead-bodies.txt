dead bodies everywhere



come on step inside and you will realize

tell me what you need tell me what to be

what your vision

you will see what do you expect of me

i cant live that lie 



hey

i have sick mom

with a fucked dad

dealing with your life

dead bodies everywhere 

you

really want me to be a good son why

you make me feel like no one 



let me strip the plain let me not give in

free me of your life inside my heart dies

your dreams never achieved do not lay that shit on me

let me live my life



you want me to be something i can never ever be



dead bodies everywhere
