looking in your eyes
tells me something wrong
never began to realize
you have neglected for so long

it seems you are never there
you never really try
and every time i want to be with you
you make up stupid lies

i feel as if
i am just your friend
that you hate being around
so do not pretend

don not say you love me
with that dreadful tone
it doesn not make sense
why you never answer your phone

it pathetic to know
you had three daughters
but you have nothing to do with any of them
that truly makes me wonder

sure our family has had problems
but not that bad that you can ignore
so if you expect me to stick around
i will walk right out of the door

you wonder why i live with dad
at least he does try
daddy has always cared about me
do you know how much this makes me cry

i feel like you are dead
because you are never there
you are dead to me
how is that fair

i have never done anything to hurt you
and your boyfriend comes before me
that bull crap mom
pay attention to me

it always poor poor pitiful you
you always have problems
you tell me your troubles
like i am supposed to stop them

you used to call every day
just to see how i was doing
now it is like you do not own a phone
as my emotions are brewing

it so hard not to cry
knowing my mother is barely around
i see girls so close the their mothers
but it is as if mine is already in the ground

do you ever cry over me mom
do you ever stop and wonder
about how i am doing
you are just a silent thunder

i hate loving you
there no point if it is not returned
my sisters hate it too
i feel like my skin is in a blazing fire being burned

trying to smile
when i am with you never seems to faze me
you were always the cool mom
but now you do not care about me

so now when you need me
i hope you know i will not be here
i hope one day you read this
and it brings a world of fear

i do not want your hugs
and fake understanding
i want a mom
who is neverending

i am sorry mom
but i gotta say
i will always love you
but never look my way
