what i have done



in this farewell

there’s no blood

there’s no alibi

‘cause i’ve drawn regret

from the truth

of a thousand lies



so let mercy come

and wash away

what i’ve done



i will face myself

to cross out what i’ve become

erase myself

and let go of what i’ve done



put to rest

what you thought of me

while i clean this slate

with the hands of uncertainty



for what i’ve done

i start again

and whatever pain may come

today this ends

i’m forgiving what i’ve done



what i’ve done

forgiving what i’ve done
