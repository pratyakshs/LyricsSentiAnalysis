down with the sickness



can you feel that

ah shit



drowning deep in my sea of loathing

broken your servant i kneel

will you give in to me

it seems what left of my human side

is slowly changing in me

will you give in to me



looking at my own reflection

when suddenly it changes

violently it changes oh no

there is no turning back now

you have woken up the demon in me



get up come on get down with the sickness 

open up your hate and let it flow into me

get up come on get down with the sickness

you mother get up come on get down with the sickness

you fucker get up come on get down with the sickness

madness is the gift that has been given to me



i can see inside you the sickness is rising

don not try to deny what you feel

will you give in to me

it seems that all that was good has died

and is decaying in me

will you give in to me



it seems you are having some trouble

in dealing with these changes

living with these changes oh no

the world is a scary place

now that you have woken up the demon in me



and when i dream

no mommy do not do it again

don not do it again

i will be a good boy

i will be a good boy i promise

no mommy do not hit me

why did you have to hit me like that mommy

don not do it you are hurting me

why did you have to be such a bitch

why do not you

why do not you just fuck off and die

why can not you just fuck off and die

why can not you just leave here and die

never stick your hand in my face again bitch

fuck you

i do not need this shit

you stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore

how would you like to see how it feels mommy

here it comes get ready to die
