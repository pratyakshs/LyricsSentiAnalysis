hey it is your funeral mama



the sky is blue the grass is brown

my head is buried inside this helmet

the ever present threat of parasites

so take my hand let get these motors running



so you drive red you drive red

and i will drive black i will drive black

we will see who machine was most recently serviced

we will slit these rows of goodyears like a knife



we do not fear

these machines



i got the scoop i got the scoop

and it doesn not look so good so good for you



so you drive red you drive red

and i will drive black i will drive black

we will see who machine was most recently serviced

we will cut this row of goodyear like a knife

like a knife like a knife yeah

we will cut this row of goodyear like a knife



so you drive red you drive red

and i will drive black i will drive black

we will see who machine was most recently serviced

we will cut this row of goodyears like a knife
