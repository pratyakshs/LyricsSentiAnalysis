the silicon chip inside her head
gets switched to overload
and nobody gonna go to school today
she gonna make them stay at home
and daddy doesn not understand it
he always said she was good as gold
and he can see no reason
cos there are no reasons
what reasons do you need to be shown

tell me why
i do not like mondays
i want to shoot
the whole day down

the telex machine is kept so clean
and it types to waiting world
and mother feels so shocked
father world is rocked
and their thoughts turn to
their own little girl
sweet 16 is not that peachy keen
no it is not so neat to admit defeat
they can see no reasons
cos there are no reasons
what reasons do you need to be shown


all the playing stopped in the playground now
she wants to play with her toys awhile
and school out early and soon we will be learning
that the lesson today is how to die
and then the bullhorn crackles
and the captain tackles
with the problems and the how and whys
and he can see no reasons
cos there are no reasons

what reasons do you need to die
