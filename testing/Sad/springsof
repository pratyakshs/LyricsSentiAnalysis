i was bruised and battered i couldn not tell what i felt 
i was unrecognizable to myself 
i saw my reflection in a window i didn not know my own face 
oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin away 
on the streets of philadelphia 

i walked the avenue til my legs felt like stone 
i heard the voices of friends vanished and gone 
at night i could hear the blood in my veins 
black and whispering as the rain 
on the streets of philadelphia 

ain not no angel gonna greet me 
it just you and i my friend 
my clothes do not fit me no more 
i walked a thousand miles 
just to slip this skin 

the night has fallen i am lyin awake 
i can feel myself fading away 
so receive me brother with your faithless kiss 
or will we leave each other alone like this 
on the streets of philadelphia
