my tea gone cold i am wondering why i
got out of bed at all
the morning rain clouds up my window
and i can not see at all
and even if i could it will all be gray
but your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it is not so bad
it not so bad


dear slim i wrote you but you still is not calling
i left my cell my pager and my home phone at the bottom
i sent two letters back in autumn you must nota got em
there probably was a problem at the post office or something
sometimes i scribble addresses too sloppy when i jot em
but anyways fuck it what been up man how your daughter
my girlfriend pregnant too i am bout to be a father
if i have a daughter guess what ima call her
ima name her bonnie
i read about your uncle ronnie too i am sorry
i had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn not want him
i know you probably hear this everyday but i am your biggest fan
i even got the underground shit that you did with skam
i got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
i like the shit you did with rawkus too that shit was fat
anyways i hope you get this man hit me back
just to chat truly yours your biggest fan
this is stan

dear slim you still is not called or wrote i hope you have a chance
i is not mad  i just think it is fucked up you do not answer fans
if you didn not wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn not have to but you coulda signed an autograph for matthew
that my little brother man he is only six years old
we waited in the blistering cold for you
four hours and you just said no
that pretty shitty man  you are like his fucking idol
he wants to be just like you man he likes you more than i do
i is not that mad though i just do not like being lied to
remember when we met in denver  you said if i would write you
you would write back  see i am just like you in a way
i never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
i can relate to what you are saying in your songs
so when i have a shitty day i drift away and put em on
cause i do not really got shit else so that shit helps when i am depressed
i even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
sometimes i even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
it like adrenaline the pain is such a sudden rush for me
see everything you say is real and i respect you cause you tell it
my girlfriend jealous cause i talk about you 247
but she do not know you like i know you slim no one does
she do not know what it was like for people like us growing up
you gotta call me man i will be the biggest fan you will ever lose
sincerely yours stan  ps
we should be together too

dear misterimtoogoodtocallorwritemyfans
this will be the last package i ever send your ass
it been six months and still no word  i do not deserve it
i know you got my last two letters
i wrote the addresses on em perfect
so this is my cassette i am sending you i hope you hear it
i am in the car right now i am doing 90 on the freeway
hey slim i drank a fifth of vodka you dare me to drive
you know the song by phil collins in the air of the night
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didnt then phil saw it all then at a show he found him
that kinda how this is you coulda rescued me from drowning
now it is too late  i am on a 1000 downers now i am drowsy
and all i wanted was a lousy letter or a call
i hope you know i ripped all of your pictures off the wall
i love you slim we coulda been together think about it
you ruined it now i hope you can not sleep and you dream about it
and when you dream i hope you can not sleep and you scream about it
i hope your conscience eats at you and you can not breathe without me
see slim screaming] shut up bitch i am trying to talk
hey slim that my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
but i didn not slit her throat i just tied her up see i is not like you
cause if she suffocates she will suffer more and then she will die too
well gotta go i am almost at the bridge now
oh shit i forgot how am i supposed to send this shit out



dear stan i meant to write you sooner but i just been busy
you said your girlfriend pregnant now how far along is she
look i am really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here an autograph for your brother
i wrote it on the starter cap
i am sorry i didn not see you at the show i musta missed you
don not think i did that shit intentionally just to diss you
but what this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
i say that shit just clowning dogg
cmon  how fucked up is you
you got some issues stan i think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
and what this shit about us meant to be together
that type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
i really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
i hope you get to read this letter i just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself i think that you will be doing just fine
if you relax a little i am glad i inspire you but stan
why are you so mad try to understand that i do want you as a fan
i just do not want you to do some crazy shit
i seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape but they didn not say who it was to
come to think about it his name was it was you
damn
