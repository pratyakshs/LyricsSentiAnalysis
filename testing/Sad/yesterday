yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
now it looks as though they are here to stay
oh i believe in yesterday

suddenly i am not half the man i used to be
there a shadow hanging over me
oh yesterday came suddenly

why she had to go i do not know she would not say
i said something wrong now i long for yesterday

yesterday love was such an easy game to play
now i need a place to hide away
oh i believe in yesterday

why she had to go i do not know she would not say
i said something wrong now i long for yesterday

yesterday love was such an easy game to play
now i need a place to hide away
oh i believe in yesterday
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
