somewhere in time i know
darling you will come back to me
roses will bloom again
but spring feels like eternity
in your kiss it wasn not goodbye
you are still the reason why

i can hear you whispering in the silence of my room
my heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon
i can barely stand this aching burning endlessly
love me now forever
were the last words you said to me

and when the morning comes
my hands still reach out for you
some things remain the same
there is nothing i can do
i can barely get through the day
ever since you went away

i can hear you whispering in the silence of my room
my heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon
i can barely stand this aching burning endlessly
love me now forever
were your last words to me 

heaven help us cross this endless sea 
with starlight above to guide you to me
waves crashing on distant shores
they are calling our names forever more

and i still hear you whispering in the silence of my room
my heart still surrenders like the sun to the moon
i can barely stand this aching burning endlessly
love me now forever
were the last words you said to me
