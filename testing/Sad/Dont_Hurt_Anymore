it do not hurt anymore
all my teardrops have dried
no more walkin the floor
with that burnin inside
just to think it could be
time has opened the door
and at last i am free
i do not hurt anymore

no use to deny i wanted to die
the day you said we were through
but now that i find you are out of my mind
i can not believe that it is true
i have forgotten somehow
that i cared so before
and it is wonderful now
i do not hurt anymore
