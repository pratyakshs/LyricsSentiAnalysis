I gotcha
I'll be right here
You listen

Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight, now
I will protect you from, all around you
I will be here don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong, now
My arms will hold you 
Keep you safe and warm, this
bond between us
Can't be broken
So im gonna be here dont you cry
Cuz

You'll be in my heart
You'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more
Why cant they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they cant explain
I know we're different
But deep inside us
We're not that different at all
You'll- you'll be in my heart
See you'll be in my heart
From this day- from this day on
Now and forever more - forever more
From this day on forever more, you'll be

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be, you'll be right here in my heart
Always

Dont listen to them
Cuz what do they know
We need each other 
To have, to hold
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

You'll be in my heart - in my heart
I'll always be there
You'll be in my heart
You know that from this day on
Now and forever more

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say no matter, no matter what they say oooh
You'll be right here in my heart
No matter oh no matter
Always

Just look over your schoulder
