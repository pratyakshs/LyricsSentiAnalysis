I know you're down again
You see nothing but rain
You put your friends through Hell
That's why we get along so well

You see
I always was your girl
Always will be
You and me against the world

We know the years can give
Romance to the street where we once lived
You wonder why no one called
Between you and me, we scared them off


Maybe we're wrong and the world is right
But don't tell me that tonight
Self assured, an amusing guest
That's the way I like you best
