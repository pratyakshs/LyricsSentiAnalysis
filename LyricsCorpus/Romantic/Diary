Lay your head on my pillow
Here you can be yourself
No one has to know what you are feelin'
No one but me and you

I wont tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

I feel such a connection
Even when you're far away
Oooh baby if there is anything that you fear 
Call 489 4608 and I'll be here

I won't tell your secrets
Your secrets are safe with me
I will keep your secrets
Just think of me as the pages in your diary

Only we know what is talked about, baby boy
Don't know how you could be driving me so crazy
When you're in town
Why don't you come around 
I'll be the loyalty you need
You can trust me
