No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes,
You always smile
But in you eyes your sorrow shows 
Yes it shows

No I can't forget tomorrow 
When I think of all my sorrow 
When I had you there but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know 

I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live 
I can't give anymore 
Can't live 
If living is without you 
can't give,
I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving 
But I guess that's just the way the story goes,
You always smile
But in you eyes your sorrow shows 
Yes it shows

Can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live 
I can't give anymore 
Can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live,
I can't give anymore

Ohhhhhh (No can't live) 
No no no (No I can't live)
I can't live (No can't live)
If living is without (No I can't live)
I can't live (No can't live)
I can't give anymore (No I can't live)
