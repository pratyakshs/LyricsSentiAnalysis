Every girl thinks I'm so lucky
Just to be with you
I know that you agree with them
But here comes the other shoe
You don't know what you've got
Since you took a gamble on me
So stop messin' 'round like you own this town
'Cause you won the lottery
Don't think I'm playin' around
'Cause we're having too much fun to see
I'm not trying to bark, but our future's dark
You know what I mean
I'm so tired of making you cry
I think we're all okay and then I wonder why
You get so mad when I'm out on my own
You like it when I'm there when you come home
I just want you and everything that we got
Girl, you know I love you and I love you alot
But I need some peace in a world so cold
You gotta know when to rock and not to roll

You gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
You gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
You gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
You gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
When to rock and not to roll

Yeah, you're cute and sexy
But that won't take us very far
Everybody's pushin' me to date a big rock star
But that don't matter to me
'Cause I'm already a queen
By the way I live and to who I give
And that's enough for me
So stop messin' 'round with my heart
'Cause you know I love ya alot
But something's gotta change
This can't stay the same
I've given all Iâ€™ve got

Girl, I'd never tell you a lie
I'm not a super hero, Just a regular guy
I think it's time that we have some fun
Can't always be worrying 'bout what I haven't done
I just want you and everything that we got
Girl, you know I love you and I love you alot
But I need some peace in a world so cold
You gotta know when to rock and not to roll

Baby, I'm not saying it's not you I wanna hold
Sometimes when it comes to you I'm so emotional
But if you want me to love you every night
You've gotta learn what it will take to make this
Girl feel right
