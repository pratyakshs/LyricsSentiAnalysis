Brandy- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute
Monica- uh huh, sure, you know you look kinda familiar
Brandy- Yeah, you do too but, umm,
I just wanted to know do you know
somebody named you,
you know his name.
Monica - Oh, yeah definitely I know his name.
Brandy - I just wanted to let you know he's mine.
Monica - Huh..no no, he's mine.

You need to give it up.
Had about enough.
It's not hard to see,
the boy is mine.

Brandy - I think it's time we got this straight,
let's sit and talk face to face.
There is no way you could mistake him for your man,
Are you insane?
Monica - See I know that you may be
just a bit jealous of me.
Cause' you're blind if you can't see
that his love is all in me.
Brandy - See I tried to hesitate,
I didn't want to say what he told me.
He said without me
he couldn't make it through the day,
ain't that a shame.
Monica - And maybe you misunderstood,
Plus I can't see how he could
wanna take his time and that's all good.
All of my love was all it took

The boy is mine.
You need to give it up.
Had about enough.
It's not hard to see,
the boy is mine.
I'm sorry that you
seem to be confused.
He belongs to me
the boy is mine.
Monica - Must you do the things you do
Keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it girl it's true.
Brandy - I think that you should realize,
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside.
Monica - You can say what you wanna say.
What we have you can't take.
From the truth you can't escape.
I can tell the real from the fake.
Brandy - When will you get the picture.
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away it's my time to shine
if you didn't know the boy is mine.


Monica - You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
Brandy - What makes you think that he wants you,
when I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart,
he was my love right from the start


Brandy: He belongs to me (sung in chorus)
Monica: The boy is mine, not yours (after chorus)
Brandy: But mine!
Monica: Not yours!
Brandy: But mine!
Monica: Not yours!
Brandy: But mine!
I'm sorry that you
seem to be confused.
He belongs to me
the boy is mine.
