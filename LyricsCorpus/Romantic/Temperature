So me give it to so me give to so me give it to to all girls
Five million and forty naughty shorty
Baby girl all my girls all my girls Sean da Paul say

Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature to shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on, and girl I
Wanna be the Papa

Make I see the gal them broke out upon the floor from you don't want no worthless performer
From you don't want no man wey can't turn you on gal make I see your hand them up on ya
Can't tan pon it long na eat no yam no steam fish nor no green banana
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

Bumper exposed and gal you got your chest out but you no wasters cause gal you impress out
And if you des out a me you fi test out,Cause I got the remedy to make you de-stress out
Me haff' flaunt it because me God bless out
And girl if you want it you haff' confess out
A no lie weh we need set speed a fi test the mattress out

Gal don't say me crazy now, this Strangelove it a no Brigitte and Flava show
Time fi a make baby now so stop gwaan like you a act shady yo
Woman don't play me know, cause a no Fred Sanford nor Grady yo
My lovin' is the way to go
My lovin' is the way to go

When you roll with a player like me with a bruther like me girl there is no other
No need to talk it right here just park it right here keep it undercover
From me love how you fit in'a you blouse and you fat in'a you jeans and me wan' discover
Everything out you baby girl can you hear when me utter
