Look at how they stop and stare
As if they've never seen a heart in love
And though I see them I don't care
'Cause I'm too busy thinking 'bout our love

Thinking about that each and every morning
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes
And though it seems I'm hooked on this fixation
I will not stop my day dreaming 
Until my nights are true with you

Oh baby my love is on fire
Oh baby my heart is on the wild
Oh baby I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

Listen at me call your name
As if you're witness to my every word
And though it seems sometimes insane
Something within me tells me they'll be heard
So I wait so patiently the moment
When my love fantasies will come to life
And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth those moments 
That I long to be with you

Oh baby my love is on fire
Oh baby my heart is on the wild
Oh baby I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

And all I need from you is confirmation
Then I'll be living truth, those moments 
That I long to be with you

Oh baby my love is on fire
Oh baby my heart is on the wild
Oh baby I'm burning with desire
I want to feel your love
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

Oh fire
Oh fire oh fire
I want to feel your love
Feel your love mixed with mine

Can't ya feel the fire burning
Can't ya feel the pulsation of my heart
Can't ya feel the fire burning
Yeah yeah, mixed with mine
