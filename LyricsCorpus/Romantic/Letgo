Drink up baby down
Are you in or are you out
Leave your things behind
'Cause it's all going off without you
Excuse me too busy you're writing your tragedy
These mess-ups
You bubble-wrap
When you've no idea what you're like

So, let go,let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown

It gains the more it gives
And then it rises with the fall
So hand me that remote
Can't you see that all that stuff's a slideshow?
Such boundless pleasure
We've no time for later
Now you can't wait
You roll your eyes
We've twenty seconds to comply

So, let go, so let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go, yeah let go
Just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown 

So, let go, so let go
Jump in
Oh well, what you waiting for
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So, let go, yeah let go
Just get in 
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
