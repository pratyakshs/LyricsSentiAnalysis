You make me smile
Even the times I'm trying to be serious
You are possessing the quality mysterious
A special style
You, you, you, you make me smile

You make me smile
Even the times our future's looking gloomier
Come through the door and then the room looks roomier
And for a while
You, you, you, you make me smile

You make me smile
That's how I feel, boy
Whenever I'm with you

You make me smile
We're never thinking that it could be so possible
Now on the other hand, It's finally probable
I'll stay a while
'Cause you, you, you, you make me smile

You make me smile
That's how I feel, boy
Whenever I'm with you
You make me smile
That's what you do to me, baby

All the things I seem to feel uptight about
Ain't so devasting after all
This must be what life is all about
Standing tall each time you take a fall

You, you, you make me smile
That's how I feel, boy
Whenever I'm with you
You make me smile
That's what you do to me, baby

You make me smile
That's how I feel, boy
Whenever I'm with you
