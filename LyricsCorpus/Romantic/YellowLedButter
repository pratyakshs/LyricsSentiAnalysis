Unsealed on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, "I wanna leave it again."
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave it again
Yeah
On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called and I said that "I want what I said" and then I call out again
And the reason oughta' leave her calm, I know
I said "I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag."

Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
But I see them round the front way
Yeah
And I know, and I know
I don't want to stay
Make me cry-

I see-
Oh I don't know why there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said, "I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag."

Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
But I see them round the front way
Yeah
And I know, and I know
I don't wanna stay at all
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay (Repeat)
