Well its 9pm and you still haven't called me back 
And if I try again I think youll feel like you under attack
I dont think I can take it I dont think I can make it
I just want this to go away

Trying to be someone that you know your not 
It gets harder everyday 
All the lonely days 
There's no one left to love
You wish life would go away

Now its 2am and im pacing around on the floor
I wait for you to come home but you never come walk through that door
Now im trying to fake it I just cant seem to shake it
I just want this to go away

Trying to be someone that you know your not 
It gets harder everyday 
All the lonely days 
There's no one left to love
You wish life would go away
You wish life would go away

I know one day ill get through this
I know one day we'll be done
I know one day ill find a way
To see you

Now its 6am and I smashed all the you left behind
I gotta throw this away these things that'll never be mine

Trying to be someone that you know your not 
It gets harder everyday 
All the lonely days 
There's no one left to love
You wish life would go away

Trying to be someone that you know your not 
It gets harder everyday 
It gets harder everyday
