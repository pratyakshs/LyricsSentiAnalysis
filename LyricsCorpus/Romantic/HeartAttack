Loving you was easy
thought you'd never leave me
yeah yeah

Wrapped around my finger
see ya when I see ya
yeah yeah

Now I'm hearing around
that you been running around

I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
ooh ohh


It hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you

I don't wanna live in a world with without you


Never really noticed
all the little things you did
you did

Never bought you roses
always was around my friends
my friends

And now I'm hearing around
that you been running around

I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
ooh ohh


It hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you

I don't wanna live in a world with without you


Never should have let you slip away
Living in a world that's turned to grey
Little did I know it hurt so bad
Cause It hit me like a heart attack...


It hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
I thought I'd never want you back
But I don't wanna live in a world with without you

I don't wanna live in a world with without you

No oh


Now I'm hearing around
that you been running around

I didn't think I'd miss you
Now I'm feeling like a fool
ooh ohh
