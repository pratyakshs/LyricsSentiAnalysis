I believe in miracles 
I believe in signs 
And I believe that mountains move 
One prayer at a time 

If I could be an angel 
I'd make your every wish come true 
But I am only human 
Just a woman 
Lovin' you 

Where your road leads 
I will follow 
When your heart bleeds 
I'll be there for you 
When your night grows dark 
And you can't find your tomorrow 
Then you can follow me 

Someday we'll look back and see 
Our footprints in the sand 
Sometimes you would carry me 
And sometimes you'd be in my hands 

If we can love forever 
That won't be long enough for me 
I want to hold you tender 
Be your shelter 
All you need 

Where your road leads 
I will follow 
When your heart bleeds 
I'll be there for you 
When your night grows dark 
And you can't find your tomorrow 
Then you can follow me 

Oh, we can be each other's guiding light 
Through this long and winding life 

Where your road leads 
I will follow 
When your heart bleeds 
I'll be there for you 
When your night grows dark 
And you can't find your tomorrow 
When you've lost sight of your dreams 
Then you can follow me
