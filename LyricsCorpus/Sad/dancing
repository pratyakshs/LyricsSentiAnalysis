Time is gonna take my mind
and carry it far away where I can fly
the depth of life will dim
my temptation to live for you

if I were to be alone silence would rock my tears
‘cause it's all about love and I know better
how life is a waving feather

so I put my arms around you, around you
and I know that I'll be leaving soon
my eyes are on you, they're on you
and you see that I can't stop shaking

no I won't step back
but I'll look down to hide from eyes
‘cause what I feel is so sweet
and I'm scared that even my own breath
oh, could burst it, if it were a bubble
and I'd better dream if I have to struggle

so I put my arms around you, around you
and I hope that I will do no wrong
my eyes are on you, they're on you
and I hope that you won't hurt me

I'm dancing in the room
as if I was in the woods with you
don't need for anything but music
music's the reason why I know time still exists
time still exists
time still exists
time still exists

so I just put my arms around you, around you
and I hope that I will do no wrong
my eyes are on you, they're on you
and I hope that you won't hurt me

my arms around you, they're round you
and I hope that I will do no wrong
my eyes are on you, they're on you, they're on you
my eyes…
