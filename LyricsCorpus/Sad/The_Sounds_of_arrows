Sitting here alone 
Staring at the floor 
No one calls me good 
I'm leaving here today 
I did everything you asked 
I did everything I could 
And all that matters now has gone for good 
But if I would fall 
Would you then meet 
Would you do anything for me 
Then I'll suppose you know that I'm let down 
And I'll understand I'll be your guy 
I'll do everything right tonight 
And I'll suppose you know that I'm let down 

So I guess you were correct 
Now my life is back 
No one called me good 
I'll leave myself today 
Washed up on the shore 
Sadder than I was before 
I gave up my existence for a better call 

So if I would fall 
What would you do 
Now I mean nothing at all to you 
I won't suppose you know that I am let down 
And I'll fade away 
I'll go to black 
I will sleep away tonight 
I'll counter attack 
You know I am not let down 
So now I fell can you see me 
1, 2, 3, 4 I am so lonely 
If this thing breaks then I'll break down
