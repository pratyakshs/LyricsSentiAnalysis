Silicon, saline, poison inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the tribe
She won't walk away
But she won't look back
She looks good
But her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess
She's a mess
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cuz when he's lookin'
She falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark (Tellem', girls)

Run run
Her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him
She looks good
But her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp
She's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp
She's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tellem', girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cuz when he's lookin'
She falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark (Tellem', girls)
In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Sylvia
Tellem' how you feel girls!

Work your blonde Jon Ben√©t Ramsey
We'll haunt like liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your jesus
Find your kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cuz when he's lookin'
She falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cuz when he's lookin'
She falls apart
