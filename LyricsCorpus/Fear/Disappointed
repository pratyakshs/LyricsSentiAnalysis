My papa says I'm great.
My hair is curly but I like it straight.
I don't go on no dates,
My mama says I'm better than them anyway.

I'm not mad at no one else.
Just disappointed in myself,
And I don't care if no one can tell,
I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I don't like my big face.
'Cause nothing in this earth needs that much space.
Don't like the dark thoughts in my mind,
They make me feel so bad all the time.

I'm not mad at no one else.
Just disappointed in myself,
And I don't care if no one can tell,
I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I'm not mad at no one else.
Just disappointed in myself,
And I don't care if no one can tell,
I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

Help feed the homeless,
Well help the insecure.
Help me find out if I'm dirty or if I'm pure.
'Cause I'm trying to figure out who I'm supposed to be.
Do I deserve to go on happily?

I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I'm not mad at no one else.
Just disappointed in myself,
And I don't care if no one can tell,
'Cause I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I'm not mad at no one else.
Just disappointed in myself,
And I don't care if no one can tell,
I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I'm not mad at no one else (wish on wishing wells)
Just disappointed in myself (they don't work so what the hell?)
And I don't care if no one can tell,
'Cause I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?

I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the hell?
I don't wish on wishing wells,
'Cause they don't work so what the?..
