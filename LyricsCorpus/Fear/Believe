Believe in me, When you feel like you're losing all your hopes and dreams
Believe in me, When I am gone you gotta keep a smile on
Believe in me, Goodbye my friends; Just celebrate the times we spent
Believe in me, We all die; It's an awfully big adventure
Believe in me, When I'm gone...

We all fall down, but we'll pick you up
We all fall down, but we'll pick you up

Believe in me, Just keep your faith and believe in all that you make
Believe in me, My love is not a gamble; You can count on me
Believe in me, No lies, Just love, I will be pure just like the sun
Believe in me, When you are down I will lift you up from the ground
Believe in me, When I'm gone...

We all fall down, but we'll pick you up
We all fall down, but we'll pick you up

If you're afraid of death
It'll come at you at the speed of light
Only if your not afraid of death
It will cast it's shadowy eyes upon you
And guide you into the eternal, infinity

Believe in me, When I'm gone...

We all fall down, but we'll pick you up
We all fall down, but we'll pick you up

I love you
