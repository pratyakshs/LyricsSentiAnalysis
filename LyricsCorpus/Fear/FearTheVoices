Awww put our heads together
Because a signature could change our future
Uh-huh
For some wrote you a letter begging you to reconsider
Yeah

Yeah Yeah Yea

Put our heads together
Ahhhhhh Ahhh Ahhhh
Fear the voices you hear today
If you steal our choices we'll blow you away

So they put number on the television Mr. Gardner
Oh yeah
A messed up generation put the pressure on you 
You're a coward, uh-huh

Yeah Yeahey

A messed up generation
Ahhhhhh Ahhh Ahhhh
Fear the voices you hear today
If you steal our choices we'll blow you away

We can see right through you, we're awake
Send your men and we are all awake
Awake, awake, awake, awake
Wake, awake, awake, awake

Fear the voices you hear today
If you steal our choices we'll blow you away
Fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices
