I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Scared of the spotlight
You don't come to visit
I'm stuck in this bed

Thin rubber gloves
She laughs when she's cryin'
She cries when she's laughin'

Fat bloody fingers
Are suckin' your soul
Away, away, away
Away, away

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
Washed down the toilet
Money to burn

Fat bloody fingers
Are sucking your soul
Away

{If you're frightened of dyin' and, and you're holdin' on
You'll see devils tearin' your life away
But, if you've made your peace
Then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the earth, from the earth, from the earth}

Rot worms on the underground
Caught between stations
Butterfingers
I'm losin' my patience

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
You got money to burn

Fat bloody fingers
Are sucking your soul
Away

Away, away, away
Away, away, away
