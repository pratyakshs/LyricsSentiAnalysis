By far worse is the hambuger lady
We must heal them for
The qualified technicians worse
Alternating nights are automatic
She's lying there

Hamburger lady
Hamburger lady

She's dying
She is burned from the waist up
On her arm
Her ear is burned
Her eyelashes are burned
She can't hold things up

And even with medical advances
There's no end in sight
For hamburger lady
She wants me to tell you of her claim mind
From which the double play laying

The propping chair leave her
She's burned from the waist down
Has to eat her life through tubes

Hamburger lady
Hamburger lady

She's okay if you change the tubes
Tubes in her legs
The tubes in her arms
She's okay
Then it came out and saw the burn net
Indeed in the account of killing

And it flashed on the carpet
And it flashed on the floor
The hamburger lady
She came to rest
Because of the burn she needs relief
From the medication
The qualified Technician

Hamburger lady
Hamburger lady
