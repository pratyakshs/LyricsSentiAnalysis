I woke up cryin' late at night when I was very young
I had dreamed my father had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
And tapped upon his door

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid
How will I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore so may I stay with you?"
And he said, "That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see"

Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west
I said, "I could make it out there if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?"

And I said, "Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?"
And he said, "That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see"

Every person carves his spot and fills the hole with life
And I pray someday I might light as bright as he

Woke up early one bright fall day to spread the tragic news
After all my travel, I settled down within a mile or two
I make my livin' with words and rhymes and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead as bits of poetry

But I say, "Daddy I'm so afraid
How will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say, I love you?"
"That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see"
"Everything I do is because of you
To seep you safe with me"
