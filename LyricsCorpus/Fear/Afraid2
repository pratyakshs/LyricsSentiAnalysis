When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might take my place
When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might take my place

Paid that money, fake that dummy, ache my tummy
On the fence, all the time
Paid junk honey, face so sunny, ain’t that funny
All my friends always lie to me
I know they’re thinking

You’re too mean, I don’t like you, fuck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won’t fight you
You suck anyway
You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might take my place [x3]
When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might end up being me

Keep on dreaming, don’t stop breathing, fight those demons
Sell your soul, not your whole self
If they see you when you’re sleeping, make them leave it
And I can’t even see if it’s all there anymore so

You’re too mean, I don’t like you, fuck you anyway
You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs
It hurts but I won’t fight you
You suck anyway
You make me wanna die, right when I

When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might take my place [x3]
When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might end up being me

Being me can only mean
Feeling scared to breathe
If you leave me then I’ll be afraid of everything
That makes me anxious, gives me patience, calms me down
Lets me face this, let me sleep, and when I wake up (I wake up, I wake up)
Let me be

When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might take my place [x3]
When I wake up I’m afraid, somebody else might end up being me
