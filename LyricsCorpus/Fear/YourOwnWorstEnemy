It's your own worst enemy Ringing the bell on the door And the person inside says nobody's home So your own worst enemy peeks inside And sees you softly weeping as some music fills the room 
And the song they play Is that guy with the messed up face Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you And your own worst enemy share." 
Full bottle in front of me Time to roll up my sleeves And get to work And after many glasses of work I get paid in the brain 
And the song they play Is that guy with the messed up face Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you And your own worst enemy share." 
And the song they play Is that guy with the messed up face Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you And your own worst enemy share." 
It's your own worst enemy
