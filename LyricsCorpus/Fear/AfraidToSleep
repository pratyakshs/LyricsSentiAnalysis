Slept in this room together 
But now you're gone 
And it's so quiet I turn the TV on 
We lived in this room together 
Remember, we painted the walls 
Now time doesn't stand still 
Though it crawls, it crawls 

And baby I'm afraid to sleep 
Cause if I do I'll always dream of you 
Dreaming always deep 
I miss you so why did I let you go 

I never realized how much I was in love with you 
Til you started sleeping with some one new 
Last night i dreamed again 
December and you were there 
I cried and you kissed my face 
And you still care, you still care 

And baby I'm afraid to sleep 
Cause if I do I'll always dream of you 
Dreaming always deep 
I miss you so why did I let you go 
Oh oh oh 
Baby I'm afraid of sleep 

Lying alone in the darkness 
With a memory in my head 
There's a big hole where my heart is 
And a lonely feeling rolling around my bed 

And baby I'm afraid to sleep 
Cause if I do I'll always dream of you 
Dreaming always deep 
I miss you so why did I let you go 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Baby I'm afraid of sleep 
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Baby I'm afraid of sleep 
Baby I'm afraid of sleep 

We slept in this room together and now you're gone
