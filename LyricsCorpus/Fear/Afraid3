do you, do you wanna bleed?
do you, do you wanna live in vain?
it's only life
she's so afraid to kiss
and so afraid to laugh
is she runnin' from her past?
it's only life
she's so afraid of love
is so afraid of hate
what's she runnin' from now??

do you, do you wanna scream?
do you, do you wanna face the strange?
do you, do you believe?
are you, are you afraid of change?

it's only life
she's so afraid of this
and so afraid to ask
she hides behind her mask
nothing's ever right
she's so afraid of pain
so afraid of blame
it's driving her insane
so insecure
there is no cure

well she's so afraid
she's so afraid of death
she's so afraid, afraid of life
the drama in her head
getting louder all the time
getting louder all the time
she's so afraid, afraid to lose
been so afraid of fame
everyday she feels the same
it's driven her insane...
it's driven her...
it's drive...
it's...

another broken pretty thing
