Give me a reason
To stay here
Cause I
Don't want
To live in fear
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

Give me a reason
To believe
Cause you don't
Wanna see me leave
I can't stop
The rain
But I can stop
The tears
Oh, I can fight
The fire
But I can't fight
The fear

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?

No more
I just can't
Live here
No more
I can't take it
Can't take it
No more
What do we
Stand for
When we all
Live in fear?
