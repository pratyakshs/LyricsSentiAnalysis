There's almost nothing left
You eat my kind for breakfast
What did i expect
To come here and find anyone?
Find open arms to greet me
And friends to feed me
I sicken myself so much
And you eat my kind for breakfast
You eat my kind
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whenever i let my guard down, whatever i was ignoring
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whatever i have been given, whatever i have been
Seeing myself this way
I am a monster i believe
And seeing is believing
Is there no doubt left
When i wake up i poison myself
And poison leaves no appetite
I sicken myself so much
I sicken myself so
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whenever i let my guard down, whatever i was ignoring
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whatever i have been given, whatever i have been
Did we expect these things to change
By waking up and suddenly there they are
And all i need's a starting place
And nothing ever seemed so hard . . .
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whenever i let my guard down, whatever i was ignoring
Whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
Whatever i have been given, whatever i have been
