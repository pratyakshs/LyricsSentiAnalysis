There's something underneath your bed,
Pull the sheets up over your head,
you hear something what was that?
Boo

Afraid of things that go bump in the night,
The candle in the pumpkin is the only light,
So get ready for the fright of your life. Yeah

Baby let me sing you a scary song,
Put on your halloween mask and sing along,
It's a creature feature baby from dusk til dawn,
Baby let me sing you a scary song,

He walks tall and carries a butcher knife
The boogieman only wants to take your life,
Can't kill him off, he'll just come right back in part two.
Boo.

Baby let me sing you a scary song,
Put on your halloween mask and sing along,
It's a creature feature baby from dusk til dawn,
Baby let me sing you a scary song.
