'Oh where, oh where, can my baby be? \nThe Lord took her away from me.\nShe\'s gone to heaven so I\'ve got to be good, \nSo I can see my baby when I leave this world.\n\nWe were out on a date in my daddy\'s car,\nWe hadn\'t driven very far.\nThere in the road straight ahead,\nA car was stalled, the engine was dead.\nI couldn\'t stop, so I swerved to the right,\nI\'ll never forget the sound that night.\nThe screaming tires, the busting glass,\nThe painful scream that I heard last.\n\n\nWhen I woke up, the rain was falling down,\nThere were people standing all around.\nSomething warm flowing through my eyes,\nBut somehow I found my baby that night.\nI lifted her head, she looked at me and said;\n\"Hold me darling just a little while.\"\nI held her close I kissed her - our last kiss,\nI found the love that I knew I had missed.\nWell now she\'s gone even though I hold her tight,\nI lost my love, my life that night.\n\n',Sad
'yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away\nNow it looks as though they\'re here to stay\nOh, I believe in yesterday\n\nSuddenly, I\'m not half the man I used to be\nThere\'s a shadow hanging over me.\nOh, yesterday came suddenly\n\nWhy she had to go I don\'t know she wouldn\'t say\nI said something wrong, now I long for yesterday\n\nYesterday, love was such an easy game to play\nNow I need a place to hide away\nOh, I believe in yesterday\n\nWhy she had to go I don\'t know she wouldn\'t say\nI said something wrong, now I long for yesterday\n\nYesterday, love was such an easy game to play\nNow I need a place to hide away\nOh, I believe in yesterday\nMm mm mm mm mm mm mm\n',Sad
'Whoa, my love\nMy darling\nI\'ve hungered for your touch\nA long, lonely time\n\nAnd time goes by so slowly\nAnd time can do so much\nAre you still mine?\n\nI need your love\nI need your love\nGod speed your love to me\n\nLonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea\nTo the open arms of the sea\nLonely rivers sigh, \"Wait for me, wait for me\nI\'ll be coming home, wait for me\"\n\nWhoa, my love\nMy darling\nI\'ve hungered, hungered for your touch\nA long, lonely time\n\nAnd time goes by so slowly\nAnd time can do so much\nAre you still mine?\n\nI need your love\nI need your love\nGod speed your love to me\n\n\n',Sad
'I sit and wait\nDoes an angel contemplate my fate\nAnd do they know\nThe places where we go\nWhen we\'re grey and old\n\'cos I have been told\nThat salvation lets their wings unfold\nSo when I\'m lying in my bed\nThoughts running through my head\nAnd I feel that love is dead\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I\'m right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\n\nWherever it may take me\nI know that life won\'t break me\nWhen I come to call she won\'t forsake me\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nWhen I\'m feeling weak\nAnd my pain walks down a one way street\nI look above\nAnd I know I\'ll always be blessed with love\nAnd as the feeling grows\nShe breathes flesh to my bones\nAnd when love is dead\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I\'m right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\nWherever it may take me\nI know that life won\'t break me\nWhen I come to call she won\'t forsake me\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\n',Sad
'Sitting here alone \nStaring at the floor \nNo one calls me good \nI\'m leaving here today \nI did everything you asked \nI did everything I could \nAnd all that matters now has gone for good \nBut if I would fall \nWould you then meet \nWould you do anything for me \nThen I\'ll suppose you know that I\'m let down \nAnd I\'ll understand I\'ll be your guy \nI\'ll do everything right tonight \nAnd I\'ll suppose you know that I\'m let down \n\nSo I guess you were correct \nNow my life is back \nNo one called me good \nI\'ll leave myself today \nWashed up on the shore \nSadder than I was before \nI gave up my existence for a better call \n\nSo if I would fall \nWhat would you do \nNow I mean nothing at all to you \nI won\'t suppose you know that I am let down \nAnd I\'ll fade away \nI\'ll go to black \nI will sleep away tonight \nI\'ll counter attack \nYou know I am not let down \nSo now I fell can you see me \n1, 2, 3, 4 I am so lonely \nIf this thing breaks then I\'ll break down\n',Sad
'Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence\nMy father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then\nSpin me around ‘til I fell asleep\nThen up the stairs he would carry me\nAnd I knew for sure I was loved\nIf I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him\nI’d play a song that would never, ever end\nHow I’d love, love, love\nTo dance with my father again\nWhen I and my mother would disagree\nTo get my way, I would run from her to him\nHe’d make me laugh just to comfort me\nThen finally make me do just what my mama said\nLater that night when I was asleep\nHe left a dollar under my sheet\nNever dreamed that he would be gone from me\nIf I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him\nI’d play a song that would never, ever end\n‘Cause I’d love, love, love\nTo dance with my father again\nSometimes I’d listen outside her door\nAnd I’d hear how my mother cried for him\nI pray for her even more than me\nI pray for her even more than me\nI know I’m praying for much too much\nBut could you send back the only man she loved\nI know you don’t do it usually\nBut dear Lord she’s dying\nTo dance with my father again\nEvery night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream\n',Sad
'Time is gonna take my mind\nand carry it far away where I can fly\nthe depth of life will dim\nmy temptation to live for you\n\nif I were to be alone silence would rock my tears\n‘cause it\'s all about love and I know better\nhow life is a waving feather\n\nso I put my arms around you, around you\nand I know that I\'ll be leaving soon\nmy eyes are on you, they\'re on you\nand you see that I can\'t stop shaking\n\nno I won\'t step back\nbut I\'ll look down to hide from eyes\n‘cause what I feel is so sweet\nand I\'m scared that even my own breath\noh, could burst it, if it were a bubble\nand I\'d better dream if I have to struggle\n\nso I put my arms around you, around you\nand I hope that I will do no wrong\nmy eyes are on you, they\'re on you\nand I hope that you won\'t hurt me\n\nI\'m dancing in the room\nas if I was in the woods with you\ndon\'t need for anything but music\nmusic\'s the reason why I know time still exists\ntime still exists\ntime still exists\ntime still exists\n\nso I just put my arms around you, around you\nand I hope that I will do no wrong\nmy eyes are on you, they\'re on you\nand I hope that you won\'t hurt me\n\nmy arms around you, they\'re round you\nand I hope that I will do no wrong\nmy eyes are on you, they\'re on you, they\'re on you\nmy eyes…\n\n',Sad
'Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,\nAnd think of you\nCaught up in circles confusion -\nIs nothing new\nFlashback - warm nights -\nAlmost left behind\nSuitcases of memories,\nTime after -\n\nSometimes you picture me -\nI\'m walking too far ahead\nYou\'re calling to me, I can\'t hear\nWhat you\'ve said -\nThen you say - go slow -\nI fall behind -\nThe second hand unwinds\n\nIf you\'re lost you can look - and you will find me\nTime after time\nIf you fall I will catch you - I\'ll be waiting \nTime after time\n\nAfter my picture fades and darkness has \nTurned to gray\nWatching through windows - you\'re wondering\nIf I\'m OK\nSecrets stolen from deep inside\nThe drum beats out of time -\nIf you\'re lost...\n\nYou said go slow -\nI fall behind\nThe second hand unwinds -\n\nIf you\'re lost...\n...Time after time\nTime after time\nTime after time\nTime after time\n\n',Sad
