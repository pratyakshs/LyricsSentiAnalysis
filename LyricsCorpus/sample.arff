'I sit and wait\nDoes an angel contemplate my fate\nAnd do they know\nThe places where we go\nWhen we\'re grey and old\n\'cos I have been told\nThat salvation lets their wings unfold\nSo when I\'m lying in my bed\nThoughts running through my head\nAnd I feel that love is dead\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I\'m right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\n\nWherever it may take me\nI know that life won\'t break me\nWhen I come to call she won\'t forsake me\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nWhen I\'m feeling weak\nAnd my pain walks down a one way street\nI look above\nAnd I know I\'ll always be blessed with love\nAnd as the feeling grows\nShe breathes flesh to my bones\nAnd when love is dead\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\nAnd through it all she offers me protection\nA lot of love and affection\nWhether I\'m right or wrong\nAnd down the waterfall\nWherever it may take me\nI know that life won\'t break me\nWhen I come to call she won\'t forsake me\nI\'m loving angels instead\n\n',Sad
'Goodbye Norma Jean\nThough I never knew you at all\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\nWhile those around you crawled\nThey crawled out of the woodwork\nAnd they whispered into your brain\nThey set you on the treadmill\nAnd they made you change your name\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\nLike a candle in the wind\nNever knowing who to cling to\nWhen the rain set in\nAnd I would have liked to have known you\nBut I was just a kid\nYour candle burned out long before\nYour legend ever did\n\nLoneliness was tough\nThe toughest role you ever played\nHollywood created a superstar\nAnd pain was the price you paid\nEven when you died\nOh the press still hounded you\nAll the papers had to say\nWas that Marilyn was found in the nude\n\nGoodbye Norma Jean\nFrom the young man in the 22nd row\nWho sees you as something as more than sexual\nMore than just our Marilyn Monroe\n',Sad
