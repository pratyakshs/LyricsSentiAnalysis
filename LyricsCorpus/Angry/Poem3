 I'm sorry you missed out when I went to school for the 1st time,
And you didn't have me tell you that you were all mine,
I'm sorry you weren't there to take me to the mall,
And you weren't there to tell me I have to stand tall,
Sorry you weren't the one I saw when I came home that day
Or the one I'd run to when I had a bad day,
I'm sorry you didn't hear me write these, you'd have been so proud,
And you weren't there to lift me up on a cloud,
Sorry you weren't there to tell me there's nothing to fear,
But then again you should have been here,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to teach me to ride a bike,
Or the one who took me on my first ride.
I'm sorry you weren't the one who carried me on his back,
that was my other daddy, the one I actually had!
Or the one who held me tight when strength is what I lacked,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to hold me when I cried,
Or tell me I did great when I really tried,
I'm sorry you were never there to teach me how to cook,
Or there at night to read me my favorite book,
I'm sorry me as a daughter is what you never had,
You will always be my father, but you will never be my dad.
