 Where were you
When I struggled to get home

Where were you
When I needed someone to confide in

Where were you
When I needed help

Where were you
When I was alone

Where were you
When I had nothing

Where were you
When I was scared

Where were you
When I was forced to bare myself

Where were you
When I needed helping hands

Where were you
When my life dwindled on life or death

Where were you
When I lost my sense of reality

Where were you
When I was being defiled

Where were you
When I was being filled with hate

Where were you
When I was surrounded by anger

Where were you
When I wanted to die

Where were you
When I wanted a hug

Where were you
When I needed confidence

Where were you
When my life was asunder

Where were you
When I felt used

Where were you
When I lost all sense of right

Where were you
When I began to forget

Where were you
When I began to deny

Where were you
When I sought only self-gratification

Where were you
When I desired truth

Where were you
When I desired understanding

Where were you
When my Mother wasn't to be found

I know where you were
You were watching me

You were watching me
Begin to hate myself

You were watching me
Be defiled

You were watching me
Struggle home

You were watching me
When I needed help

You were watching me
Deny the truth

You were watching me
Seek truth

You were watching me
Be surrounded with anger

You were watching me
Be live for and with hate

You were watching me
When I was alone

You were watching me
When I needed a confidant

You were watching me
Lose my sense of self

You were watching me
Seek after my own demise

You were watching me
Fill my cup with self-gratification

You were watching me
When I needed more hands

You were watching me
When I was scared

You were watching me
Be forced upon

You were watching me
As I was in need

You were watching me
As death knocked at my door

You were watching me
Need love and attention

You were watching me
Lose self-esteem

You were watching me
When I forgot truth

You were watching me
Believe lies

You were watching me
When I sought understanding

All this time you only watched
My own mother ONLY watched.
