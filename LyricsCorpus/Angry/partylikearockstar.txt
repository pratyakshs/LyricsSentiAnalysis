I'm on a money making mission
But I party like a rockstar
Flyin' down 20 lookin' good in my hot car
You know them hoes be at my show
Worried 'bout where my chain go
I uh rubba in ma pants
But these hoes won't let my thang go

I uwa like I uwa
'Cause you know them hoes be trying us
Hoe don't you know I fuck with fine diamonds
That look like Pa-me-la
They fine and they hot bra
When I'm in the spot bra......
I PARTY LIKE a ROCKSTAAARRR!!!!!!

Party like a rockstar
Do it with the black and the white
Like a cop car
Whoop, whoop, whoop, wha, whoop
Me and my band, man
On the yacht with Marylin Manson
Getting a tan man
Uuwaaa

(Cool) you know me
With a skull belt and wallet chain
Shop boys, rockstars
Yeah, we 'bout to change the game
Change the game? Uh oh
They know that I'm a star
I make it rain from the center of my guitar


As soon as I came out the womb
My momma knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course
Trippin' with the Osbournes
I seen the show with Travis Barker
Rockstar mentality
I'm jumping in the crowd
Just to see if they would carry me

White bitches wanna marry me
They see me they just might panic
My ice make 'em go down quick
Like the TITANIC!!
Yeah, I'm with the shop boys
You know what we do
I'm surfin' screamin' kowabonga
TOTALLY DUDE!!
