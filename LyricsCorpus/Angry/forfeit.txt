"Forfeit"

Will not be shaken,
And jump into this,
And be persuasive, just carry on.
Make my mind up, to go though this,
Or be firm and sit in silence.

'Cause I want to fight,
I want to fight,
I want to prove I'm right.
I want to fight,
I want to fight,
So turn and forfeit.

Forfeit.

Learn from this,
Prehistoric dance and
Refrain from talking,
Solves our problems.

Medicated, could do some good,
Or find a way to relate,
Or just shut up.

'Cause I want to fight,
I want to fight,
I want to prove I'm right.
I want to fight,
I want to fight,
So turn and forfeit.

Forfeit...
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.

I want to fight,
I want to fight,
I want to prove I'm right.
I want to fight,
I want to fight,
I want to prove I'm right.
I want to fight,
I want to fight,
So turn and forfeit.
I want to fight,
I want to fight,
So turn and forfeit.

So step up.
So step up...
And forfeit.
So step up.

Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
Forfeit.
