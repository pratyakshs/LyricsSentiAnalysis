Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

I have kissed your lips a thousand times
And more times than I can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me in my darkest hour

Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

In our years together
We have had stormy weather
But our love has been so strong
That somehow we've carried on

Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

Girl, you brought joy to my delight
And all that was wrong
You have made it right
And I love, I love, I love you

Oh, how happy
You have made me
Oh, how happy
You have made me

(Oh, how happy)
    Oh, how happy
    (Oh, how happy)
    Oh, how happy
    (Oh, how happy)
    You

    (You have made me)
    You have made me
    (You have made me)
    You have made me
    (You have made me)
    You have made me
