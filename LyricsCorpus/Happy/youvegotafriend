When you're down and troubled and you need a helping hand
and nothing, whoa, nothing is going right.
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
to brighten up even your darkest nights.

You just call out my name, and you know where ever I am
I'll come running to see you again.
Winter, spring, summer, or fall, all you have to do is call and I'll be there, yeah, yeah,
    you've got a friend.

    If the sky above you should turn dark and full of clouds
    and that old north wind should begin to blow,
    keep your head together and call my name out loud.
    Soon I will be knocking upon your door.
    You just call out my name, and you know where ever I am
    I'll come running to see you again.
    Winter, spring, summer, or fall, all you have to do is call and I'll be there.

    Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend? People can be so cold.
    They'll hurt you and desert you. Well, they'll take your soul if you let them,
    oh yeah, but don't you let them.

    You just call out my name, and you know where ever I am
    I'll come running to see you again.
    Winter, spring, summer, or fall, all you have to do is call, Lord, I'll be there, yeah, yeah,
    you've got a friend. You've got a friend.
    Ain't it good to know you've got a friend. Ain't it good to know you've got a friend.
    Oh, yeah, yeah, you've got a friend.
