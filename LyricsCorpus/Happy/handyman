Hey girls, gather round, listen to what I'm putting down.
Hey babe, I'm your handy man.
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule, I'm handy with love and I'm no fool,
    I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can.

    If your broken heart should need repair, then I'm the man to see.
    I whisper sweet things, you tell all your friends, they'll come running to me.

    Here is the main thing I want to say, I'm busy 24 hours a day.
    I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can.
    Comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    Comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah, they'll come running to me.

    Here is the main thing I want to say, I'm busy 24 hours a day.
    I fix broken hearts, I know that I truly can.
    Comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    Comma, comma, comma, com, com, yeah, yeah, yeah.
