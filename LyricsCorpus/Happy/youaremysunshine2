The other night dear
As I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear
I was mistaken
So I hung my head and cried.

You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are gray
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away.

So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never loose
And frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in.

My mommy told me something
That little girls should know
It's all about the devil
And I've learned to hate him so
I know he'll be unhappy
'Cause I'll never wear a frown
Maybe if we keep on smiling
He'll get tired of hangin' round.

So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never loose
And frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in.

So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Smilers never loose
And frowners never win
So let the sun shine in
Face it with a grin
Open up your heart and let the sun shine in...
