Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry be happy
In every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry, be happy)

    Ain't got no place to lay your head
    Somebody came and took your bed
    Don't worry, be happy
    The land lord say your rent is late
    He may have to litigate
    Don't worry, be happy
(Look at me I am happy)

    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be Happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    Here I give you my phone number
    When you worry call me, I make you happy
    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh

    Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
    Ain't got no girl to make you smile
    But don't worry be happy
    'Cause when you worry
    Your face will frown
    And that will bring everybody down
    So don't worry, be happy
    Don't worry, be happy now

    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    Don't worry, be happy
    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    Don't worry be happy
    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry sweetie, be happy)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    (Put a smile on your face, don't bring everybody down)
    Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
    (Don't worry)
    Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(It will soon pass, celebrate it)
    Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
    Don't worry, be happy
    I'm not worried, I'm happy
