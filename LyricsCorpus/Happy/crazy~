Crazy
I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
I'm crazy
Crazy for feeling so blue
I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted
And then some day
You'd leave me for somebody new

Worry
Why do I let myself worry?
Wondering
What in the world did I do?

Oh, crazy
For thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving you

Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
I'm crazy for trying
And crazy for crying
And I'm crazy for loving
You

Crazy I’m crazy for feeling so lonely 
I’m crazy crazy for feeling so blue 
I knew you’d love me as long as you wanted 
And then someday you’d leave me for somebody new 
Worry why do I let myself worry 
Wondering what in the world did I do 
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you 
I’m crazy for trying and crazy for crying 
And I’m crazy for loving you
