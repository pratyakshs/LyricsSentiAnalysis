I used to think maybe you love me, now baby I'm sure
And I just cant wait till the day, when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mail box, gotta hold myself down
'cause I just cant wait till you write me, you're coming around

I'm walking on sunshine (whoa oh)
I'm walking on sunshine (whoa oh)

And don't it feel good (HEY!) Alright now
And don't it feel good (HEY!) Alright now
All right now yeah! (HEY!)

    I used to think maybe you love me, I know that it's true
    And I don't wanna spend all of my life just waiting for you (just waiting for you)
    Now I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
    Baby I just want you back and I want you to stay
