I'm checking out
Of Hotel Loneliness
All my lonely days
They're all through
I'm checking into
Hotel Happiness
Because, darling
I found you
I left my teardrops
In that old lonely room
Left my broken heart
Back there, too
I won't be needing them
In Hotel Happiness
Cause, darling, I found you
I woke up dreaming of
Your crazy kisses
I woke up telling Mr. Misery
Here's your key cause
I'm checking out
Of Hotel Loneliness
No, I won't be back
Yes, it's true
Gonna make my new address
At Hotel Happiness
You know why, darling
So glad I found you
No more, make my new
Address at Hotel Happiness
Cause, darling, I found you
