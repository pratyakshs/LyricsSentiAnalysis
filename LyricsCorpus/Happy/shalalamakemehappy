Sha la la la la la la,
    oh baby,
    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    oh baby,
    I've been gone so long I know what to do,
    oh baby,
    that I know you don't know what I've been going through,
    oh baby,
    'cause you make me happy baby, so I can say,

    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    I love you,
    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    Thinkin' of you,
    I know you can tell what's on my mind,
    oh baby,
    and I've been feeling this way for such a long time,
    ya, baby,
    aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy, I wanna say,

    I'm trying, this feeling just won't die,
    oh,
    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    Make you cry,
    It's something that just gets down in your bones,
    baby,
    And once I see you I can't leave your love alone,
    Ya, heh, baby,
    aw, make me happy baby, aw, make me happy baby, let me sing,

    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    oh baby,
    Sha la la la-- la la la,
    oh baby...
