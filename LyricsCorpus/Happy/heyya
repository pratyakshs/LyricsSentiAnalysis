One, two, three, uh!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure.
Uh, But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door.
Don't try to fight the feelin'
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now..
Uh, thank god for mom and dad
For sticking two together
'Cause we don't know how...
UH!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But got it just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception
So why you, why you
Why you, why you, why you are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here...
Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance
