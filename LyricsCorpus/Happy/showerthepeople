You can play the game and you can act out the part,
    even though you know it wasn't written for you.
    Tell me, how can you stand there with your broken heart ashamed of playing the fool?
    One thing can lead to another; it doesn't take any sacrifice.
    Oh, father and mother, sister and brother, if it feels nice, don't think twice,
    just shower the people you love with love, show them the way that you feel.
    Things are gonna work out fine if you only will do as I say, just
    shower the people you love with love, show them the way you feel.
    Things are gonna be much better if you only will.

    You can run but you cannot hide, this is widely known.
    Tell me, what you plan to do with your foolish pride when you're all by yourself, alone.
    Once you tell somebody the way that you feel, you can feel it beginning to ease.
    I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel always getting the grease.
    Better to shower the people you love with love, show them the way that you feel.
    Things are gonna be just fine if you only will what I'd like to do to you.
    Shower the people you love with love, show them the way that you feel.
    Things are gonna be much better if you only will.

    Shower the people you love with love, show them the way that you feel.
    You'll feel better right away.
    Don't take much to do, sell you pride.
    They say in every life, they say the rain must fall, just like pouring rain, make it rain.
    Make it rain, love, love, love is sunshine, oh yes,
    Make it rain, love, love, love is sunshine. Everybody, everybody.
