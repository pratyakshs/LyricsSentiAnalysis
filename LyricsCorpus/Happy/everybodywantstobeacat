Everybody wants to be a cat,
          because a cat's the only cat
          who knows where it's at.
          Everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat,
          'cause everything else is obsolete.
          Now a square with a horn,
          can make you wish you weren't born,
          ever'time he plays;
and with a square in the act,
    he can set music back
    to the caveman days.
    I've heard some corny birds who tried to sing,
    but a cat's the only cat
    who knows how to swing.
    Who wants to dig
    a long-haired gig
    or stuff like that?
    When everybody wants to be a cat.
    A square with that horn,
    makes you wish you weren't born,
    ever'time he plays;
and with a square in the act,
    he's gonna set this music back
    to the Stone Age days.
    Everybody wants to be a cat,
    because a cat's the only cat
    who knows where it's at;
    while playin' jazz you always has a Welcome mat,
    'cause everybody digs a swingin' cat.
    Everybody digs a swingin' cat.
