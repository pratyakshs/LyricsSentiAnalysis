Splish, splash
I was takin' a bath
Long about a Saturday night... yeah!
Rub-a-dub
Just relaxin' in the tub
Thinkin' everything was all right.

Well... I stepped out the tub
Put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me
And I opened the door.

And... then-a... splish, splash
I jumped back in the bath
Well... how was I to know
There was a party going on.

They was a splishin' and a splashin'
Reelin' with the feelin'
Moving and a groovin'
Rockin' and a rollin'... yeah!

Bing, bang
I saw the whole gang
Dancin' on my living room rug... yeah...
Flip flop
They was doin' the bop
All the teens had the dancin' bug.

There was Lollipop with-a Peggy Sue
Good Golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too!
A-well-a.... splish, splash
I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancin' shoes on... yea!

I was a rollin' and a strollin'
Reelin' with the feelin'
Movin' and a groovin'
Splishin' and a splashin'... yeah!

Yes... I was a splishin' and a splashin'
I was a rollin' and a strollin'
Yeah... I was a movin' and a groovin' ... woo!
We was a reelin' with the feelin'... ha!
We was a rollin' and a strollin'
Movin' with the groovin'
Splish, splash... yeah!

I was a splishin' and a splashin'... one time...
I was a splishin' and a splashin'... woo-woo!
I was a movin' and a-groovin'...
