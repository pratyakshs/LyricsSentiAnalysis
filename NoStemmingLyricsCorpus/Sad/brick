6 am day after christmas
i throw some clothes on in the dark
the smell of cold
car seat is freezing
the world is sleeping
i am numb

up the stairs to the apartment
she is balled up on the couch
her mom and dad went down to charlotte
they are not home to find us out
and we drive
now that i have found someone
i am feeling more alone
than i ever have before

she a brick and i am drowning slowly
off the coast and i am headed nowhere
she a brick and i am drowning slowly

they call her name at 730
i pace around the parking lot
then i walk down to buy her flowers
and sell some gifts that i got
can not you see
it not me you are dying for
now she is feeling more alone
than she ever has before

she a brick and i am drowning slowly
off the coast and i am headed nowhere
she a brick and i am drowning slowly

as weeks went by
it showed that she was not fine
they told me son it is time to tell the truth
and she broke down and i broke down
cause i was tired of lying

driving back to her apartment
for the moment we are alone
but she is alone
and i am alone
and now i know it

she a brick and i am drowning slowly
off the coast and i am headed nowhere
she a brick and i am drowning slowly
