and so it is
just like you said it would be
life goes easy on me
most of the time
and so it is
the shorter story
no love no glory
no hero in her sky

i can not take my eyes off of you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes off of you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes

and so it is
just like you said it should be
we will both forget the breeze
most of the time
and so it is
the colder water
the blower daughter
the pupil in denial

i can not take my eyes off of you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes off of you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes off you
i can not take my eyes

did i say that i loathe you
did i say that i want to
leave it all behind

i can not take my mind off of you
i can not take my mind off you
i can not take my mind off of you
i can not take my mind off you
i can not take my mind off you
i can not take my mind
my mindmy mind
til i find somebody new
