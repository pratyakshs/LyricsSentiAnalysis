he needs a quiet room
with a lock to keep him in
it just a quiet room
and he is there

he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friends guitar
that he played

he never been in love
but he knows just what love is
he said nevermind
and noone speaks

he thinks he drinks too much
cos when he tells his too best friends
i think i drink too much
noone speaks
noone speaks
noone speaks

he plays an old guitar
with a coin found by the phone
it was his friends guitar
that he played

when he plays
noone speaks
noone speaks
when he plays
noone speaks
