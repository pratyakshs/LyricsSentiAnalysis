back when i was a child before life removed all the innocence
my father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
spin me around ‘til i fell asleep
then up the stairs he would carry me
and i knew for sure i was loved
if i could get another chance another walk another dance with him
i’d play a song that would never ever end
how i’d love love love
to dance with my father again
when i and my mother would disagree
to get my way i would run from her to him
he’d make me laugh just to comfort me
then finally make me do just what my mama said
later that night when i was asleep
he left a dollar under my sheet
never dreamed that he would be gone from me
if i could steal one final glance one final step one final dance with him
i’d play a song that would never ever end
‘cause i’d love love love
to dance with my father again
sometimes i’d listen outside her door
and i’d hear how my mother cried for him
i pray for her even more than me
i pray for her even more than me
i know i’m praying for much too much
but could you send back the only man she loved
i know you don’t do it usually
but dear lord she’s dying
to dance with my father again
every night i fall asleep and this is all i ever dream
