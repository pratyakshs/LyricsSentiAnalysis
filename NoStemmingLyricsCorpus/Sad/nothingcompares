it been seven hours and fifteen days
since u took your love away
i go out every night and sleep all day
since u took your love away

since u been gone i can do whatever i want
i can see whomever i choose
i can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
but nothing
i said nothing can take away these blues

`cause nothing compares
nothing compares 2 u

it been so lonely without u here
like a bird without a song
nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
tell me baby where did i go wrong

i could put my arms around every boy i see
but they would only remind me of you
i went to the doctor and guess what he told me
guess what he told me
he said girl you better try to have fun no matter what you do
but he is a fool

`cause nothing compares
nothing compares 2 u

all the flowers that u planted mama
in the back yard
all died when u went away
i know that living with u baby was sometimes hard
but i am willing to give it another try

nothing compares
nothing compares 2 u
nothing compares
nothing compares 2 u
nothing compares
nothing compares 2 u
