i do not want to understand this horror
there a weight in your eyes
i can not admit
everybody ends up here in bottles
but the name tag the last thing you wanted

as the world explodes
we fall out of it
and we can not let go
because this will not go away
there a house built out in space

i can not see that thief
that lives inside of your head
but i can be some courage at
the side of you bed
i do not know what happening
and i can not pretend
but i can be your be your

someone help us understand
who ordered this disgusting
arrangement time and the end
i do not want to hear who walked
on water because the hallways are empty
and the clocks tick

as the world implodes
we fall into it
and we can not go home
because this will not go away
there a house built out in space

i can not see that thief
that lives inside of your head
but i can be some courage at
the side of you bed
i do not know what happening
and i can not pretend

it a long long get away
it a long long get away
make it home again
make it home again
it a long long get away
it a long long get away

i can not see that thief
that lives inside of your head
but i can be some courage at
the side of you bed
i do not know what happening
and i can not pretend
but i can be your be your
