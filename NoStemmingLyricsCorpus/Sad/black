hey oooh

sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay
were laid spread out before me as her body once did
all of five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
now the air i tasted and breathed has taken a turn

ooh and all i taught her was everything
ooh i know she gave me all that she was

and now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything
oh the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything

i take a walk outside i am surrounded by some kids at play
i can feel their laughter so why do i sear
oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head i am spinning oh
i am spinning how quick the sun can drop away

and now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything
all the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything

all the love gone bad turned my world to black
tattooed all i see all that i am all i will be yeah

uh huh uh huh ooh

i know someday you will have a beautiful life
i know you will be a sun in somebody else sky
but why why why can not it be can not it be mine

aah uuh

too doo doo too too doo doo
