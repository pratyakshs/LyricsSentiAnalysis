they made up their minds 
and they started packing 
they left before the sun came up that day 
an exit to eternal summer slacking 
but where were they going without ever 
knowing the way 

they drank up the wine 
and they got to talking 
they now had more important things to say 
and when the car broke down they started walking 
where were they going without ever 
knowing the way 

chorus]
anyone can see the road that they walk on 
is paved in gold 
and it is always summer 
they will never get cold 
they will never get hungry 
they will never get old and grey 
you can see their shadows wandering off somewhere 
they won not make it home 
but they really don not care 
they wanted the highway 
they are happier there today today 

their children woke up 
and they couldn not find them 
they left before the sun came up that day 
they just drove off and left it all behind em 
but where were they going without ever 
knowing the way
