hold on
hold on to yourself
for this is gonna hurt like hell
hold on
hold on to yourself
you know that only time will tell
what is it in me that refuses to believe
this isn not easier than the real thing
my love
you know that you are my best friend
you know i would do anything for you
my love
let nothing come between us
my love for you is strong and true
am i in heaven here or am i
at the crossroads i am standing
so now you are sleeping peaceful
i lie awake and pray
that you will be strong tomorrow and well
see another day and we will praise it
and love the light that brings a smile
across your face
oh god if you are out there will not you hear me
i know that we have never talked before
oh god the man i love is leaving
won not you take him when he comes to your door
am i in heaven here or am i in hell
at the crossroads i am standing
now you are sleeping peaceful
i lie awake and pray
that you will be strong tomorrow and well
see another day and we will praise it
and love the light that brings a smile
across your face
hold on
hold on to yourself
for this is gonna hurt like hell
