creep

when you were here before
couldn not look you in the eye
you are just like an angel
your skin makes me cry
you float like a feather
in a beautiful world
i wish i was special
you are so fucking special

but i am a creep
i am a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here
i don not belong here

i don not care if it hurts
i want to have control
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to notice when i am not around
you are so fucking special
i wish i was special

but i am a creep
i am a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here
i don not belong here

she running out the door
she running out
she runs runs runs runs
runs

whatever makes you happy
whatever you want
you are so fucking special
i wish i was special

but i am a creep
i am a weirdo
what the hell am i doing here
i don not belong here
i don not belong here
