oh where oh where can my baby be 
the lord took her away from me
she gone to heaven so i have got to be good 
so i can see my baby when i leave this world

we were out on a date in my daddy car
we hadn not driven very far
there in the road straight ahead
a car was stalled the engine was dead
i couldn not stop so i swerved to the right
i will never forget the sound that night
the screaming tires the busting glass
the painful scream that i heard last


when i woke up the rain was falling down
there were people standing all around
something warm flowing through my eyes
but somehow i found my baby that night
i lifted her head she looked at me and said
hold me darling just a little while
i held her close i kissed her  our last kiss
i found the love that i knew i had missed
well now she is gone even though i hold her tight
i lost my love my life that night
