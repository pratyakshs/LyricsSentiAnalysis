time is gonna take my mind
and carry it far away where i can fly
the depth of life will dim
my temptation to live for you

if i were to be alone silence would rock my tears
‘cause it is all about love and i know better
how life is a waving feather

so i put my arms around you around you
and i know that i will be leaving soon
my eyes are on you they are on you
and you see that i can not stop shaking

no i will not step back
but i will look down to hide from eyes
‘cause what i feel is so sweet
and i am scared that even my own breath
oh could burst it if it were a bubble
and i would better dream if i have to struggle

so i put my arms around you around you
and i hope that i will do no wrong
my eyes are on you they are on you
and i hope that you will not hurt me

i am dancing in the room
as if i was in the woods with you
don not need for anything but music
music the reason why i know time still exists
time still exists
time still exists
time still exists

so i just put my arms around you around you
and i hope that i will do no wrong
my eyes are on you they are on you
and i hope that you will not hurt me

my arms around you they are round you
and i hope that i will do no wrong
my eyes are on you they are on you they are on you
my eyes…
