sitting here alone 
staring at the floor 
no one calls me good 
i am leaving here today 
i did everything you asked 
i did everything i could 
and all that matters now has gone for good 
but if i would fall 
would you then meet 
would you do anything for me 
then i will suppose you know that i am let down 
and i will understand i will be your guy 
i will do everything right tonight 
and i will suppose you know that i am let down 

so i guess you were correct 
now my life is back 
no one called me good 
i will leave myself today 
washed up on the shore 
sadder than i was before 
i gave up my existence for a better call 

so if i would fall 
what would you do 
now i mean nothing at all to you 
i won not suppose you know that i am let down 
and i will fade away 
i will go to black 
i will sleep away tonight 
i will counter attack 
you know i am not let down 
so now i fell can you see me 
1 2 3 4 i am so lonely 
if this thing breaks then i will break down
