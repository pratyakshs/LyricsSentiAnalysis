when your day is long
and the night the night is yours alone
when you are sure you have had enough
of this life well hang on

don not let yourself go
cause everybody cries
and everybody hurts sometimes

sometimes everything is wrong
now it is time to sing along
when your day is night alone hold on hold on
if you feel like letting go hold on
if you think you have had too much
of this life well hang on

everybody hurts
take comfort in your friends
everybody hurts
don not throw your hand oh no

don not throw your hand
if you feel like you are alone
no no no you are not alone

if you are on your own in this life
the days and nights are long
when you think you have had too much of this life to hang on

well everybody hurts sometimes
everybody cries
everybody hurts sometimes
and everybody hurts sometimes

so hold on hold on
hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on
everybody hurts
