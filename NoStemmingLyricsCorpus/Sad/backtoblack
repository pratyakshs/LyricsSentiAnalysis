he left no time to regret
kept his dick wet
with his same old safe bet
me and my head high
and my tears dry
get on without my guy

you went back to what you knew
so far removed from all that we went through
and i tread a troubled track
my odds are stacked
i will go back to black

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her
and i go back to

i go back to us

i love you much
it not enough
you love blow and i love puff
and life is like a pipe
and i am a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her
and i go back to

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her
and i go back to

black black black black black black black
i go back to
i go back to

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her
and i go back to

we only said goodbye with words
i died a hundred times
you go back to her
and i go back to black
