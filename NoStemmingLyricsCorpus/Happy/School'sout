well we got no choice
all the girls and boys
makin all that noise
cause they found new toys
well we can not salute ya
can not find a flag
if that do not suit ya
that a drag

school out for summer
school out forever
school been blown to pieces

no more pencils
no more books
no more teacher dirty looks

well we got no class
and we got no principles
and we got no innocence
we can not even think of a word that rhymes

school out for summer
school out forever
school been blown to pieces

no more pencils
no more books
no more teacher dirty looks

out for summer
out till fall
we might not go back at all

school out forever
school out for summer
school out with fever
school out completely
