here comes the sun here comes the sun
     and i say it is all right

     little darling it is been a long cold lonely winter
     little darling it feels like years since it is been here
     here comes the sun here comes the sun
     and i say it is all right

     little darling the smiles returning to the faces
     little darling it seems like years since it is been here
     here comes the sun here comes the sun
     and i say it is all right

     sun sun sun here it comes
     sun sun sun here it comes
     sun sun sun here it comes
     sun sun sun here it comes
     sun sun sun here it comes

     little darling i feel that ice is slowly melting
     little darling it seems like years since it is been clear
     here comes the sun here comes the sun
     and i say it is all right
     it is all right
