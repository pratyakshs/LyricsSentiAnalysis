sometimes in our lives
we all have pain we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there always tomorrow

lean on me when you are not strong
and i will be your friend i will help you carry on
for it will not be long
til i am gonna need somebody to lean on

please swallow your pride
if i have things you need to borrow
for no one can fill those of your needs
that you will not let show

you just call on me brother when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
i just might have a problem that you will understand
we all need somebody to lean on

lean on me when you are not strong
and i will be your friend i will help you carry on
for it will not be long
til i am gonna need somebody to lean on

you just call on me brother when you need a hand
we all need somebody to lean on
i just might have a problem that you will understand
we all need somebody to lean on

if there is a load
you have to bear that you can not carry
i am right up the road i will share your load
if you just call me
