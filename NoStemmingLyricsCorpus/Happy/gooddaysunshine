good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

i need to laugh and when the sun is out
i have got something i can laugh about
i feel good in a special way
i am in love and it is a sunny day

good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

we take a walk the sun is shining down
burns my feet as they touch the ground

good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine

then we would lie beneath the shady tree
i love her and she is loving me
she feels good she knows she is looking fine
i am so proud to know that she is mine

good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
good day sunshine good day sunshine good day sunshine
good day
