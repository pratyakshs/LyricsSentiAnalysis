birds flying high
you know how i feel
sun in the sky
you know how i feel
reeds driftin on by
you know how i feel

it a new dawn
it a new day
it a new life
for me
and i am feeling good

fish in the sea
you know how i feel
river running free
you know how i feel
blossom in the trees
you know how i feel

it a new dawn
it a new day
it a new life
for me
and i am feeling good

dragonfly out in the sun
you know what i mean do not you know
butterflies all out havin fun
you know what i mean
sleep in peace when day is done
and this old world is a new world
and a bold world
for me

stars when you shine
you know how i feel
scent of the pine
you know how i feel
yeah freedom is mine
and you know how i feel

it a new dawn
it a new day
it a new life
for me
and i am feeling good
