happy birthday sweet sixteen
tonight the night i have waited for
because you are not a baby anymore
you have turned into the prettiest girl i have ever seen
happy birthday sweet sixteen
what happened to that funny face
my little tomboy now wears satin and lace
i can not believe my eyes you are just a teenage dream
happy birthday sweet sixteen
when you were only six
i was your big brother
then when you were ten
we didn not like each other
when you were thirteen
you were my funny valentine
but since you have grown up
your future is sewn up
from now on you are gonna be mine so

if i should smile with sweet surprise
it just that you have grown up before my very eyes
you have turned into the prettiest girl i have ever seen
happy birthday sweet sixteen

if i should smile with sweet surprise
it just that you have grown up before my very eyes
you have turned into the prettiest girl i have ever seen
happy birthday sweet sixteen
