baby evrything is all right uptight out of sight
baby evrything is all right uptight out of sight

i am a poorman son from across the railroad tracks
the only shirt i own is hangin on my back
but i am the envy of evry single guy
since i am the apple of my girl eye
when we go out stepping on the town for a while
my money low and my suit out of style
but it is all right if my clothes aren not new
out of sight because my heart is true

she says baby evrything is alright uptight out of sight
baby evrything is alright uptight clean out of sight

she a pearl of a girl i guess that what you might say
i guess her folks brought her up that way
the right side of the tracks she was born and raised
in a great big old house full of butlers and maids
she says no one is better than i i know i am just an average guy
no football hero or smooth don juan
got empty pockets you see i am a poorman son
she says give her the things that money can buy
but i will never never make my baby cry

and it is all right what i can not do
out of sight because my heart is true
she says baby evrything is alright uptight clean out of sight
baby evrything is alright uptight clean out of sight
baby evrything is alright uptight ah ah ah ah
baby evrything is alright uptight clean out of sight
baby evrything is alright uptight clean out of sight
