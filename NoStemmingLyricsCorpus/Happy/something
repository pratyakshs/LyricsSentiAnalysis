something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she woos me

i do not want to leave her now
you know i believe and how

somewhere in her smile she knows
that i do not need no other lover
something in her style that shows me

don not want to leave her now
you know i believe and how

you are asking me will my love grow
i do not know i do not know
you stick around now it may show
i do not know i do not know

something in the way she knows
and all i have to do is think of her
something in the things she shows me

don not want to leave her now
you know i believe and how
