the other night dear
as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
when i awoke dear
i was mistaken
so i hung my head and cried

you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy
when skies are gray
you will never know dear
how much i love you
please do not take my sunshine away

so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
smilers never loose
and frowners never win
so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
open up your heart and let the sun shine in

my mommy told me something
that little girls should know
it all about the devil
and i have learned to hate him so
i know he will be unhappy
cause i will never wear a frown
maybe if we keep on smiling
he will get tired of hangin round

so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
smilers never loose
and frowners never win
so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
open up your heart and let the sun shine in

so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
smilers never loose
and frowners never win
so let the sun shine in
face it with a grin
open up your heart and let the sun shine in
