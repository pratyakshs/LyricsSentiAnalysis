i took my troubles down to madame ruth
you know that gypsy with the goldcapped tooth
she got a pad down on thirtyfourth and vine
sellin little bottles of love potion number nine

i told her that i was a flop with chicks
i would been this way since 1956
she looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
she said what you need is love potion number nine

she bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
she said i am gonna make it up right here in the sink
it smelled like turpentine it looked like india ink
i held my nose i closed my eyes i took a drink

i didn not know if it was day or night
i started kissin everything in sight
but when i kissed a cop down on thirtyfourth and vine
he broke my little bottle of love potion number nine

i held my nose i closed my eyes i took a drink

i didn not know if it was day or night
i started kissin everything in sight
but when i kissed a cop down on thirtyfourth and vine
he broke my little bottle of love potion number nine

love potion number nine love potion number nine
love potion number nine
