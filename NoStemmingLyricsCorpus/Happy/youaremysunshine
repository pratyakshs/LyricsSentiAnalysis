you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey
you never know dear how much i love you
please do not take my sunshine away

the other night dear as i lay sleeping
i dreamt i held you in my arms
when i awoke dear i was mistaken
so i hung my head and i cried

you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey
you never know dear how much i love you
please do not take my sunshine away

i will always love you and make you happy
if you will only say the same
but if you leave me to love another
    you will regret it all one day

    you are my sunshine my only sunshine
    you make me happy when skies are grey
    you never know dear how much i love you
    please do not take my sunshine away

    please do not take my sunshine away
