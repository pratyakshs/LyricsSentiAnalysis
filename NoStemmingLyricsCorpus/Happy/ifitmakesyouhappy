i have been long a long way from here
put on a poncho played for mosquitos
    and drank til i was thirsty again
    we went searching through thrift store jungles
    found geronimo rifle marilyn shampoo
    and benny goodman corset and pen

    well ok i made this up
    i promised you i would never give up

    if it makes you happy
    it can not be that bad
    if it makes you happy
    then why the hell are you so sad

    you get down real low down
    you listen to coltrane derail your own train
    well who hasn not been there before
    i come round around the hard way
    bring you comics in bed scrape the mold off the bread
    and serve you french toast again

    well ok i still get stoned
    i am not the kind of girl you would take home


    we have been far far away from here
    put on a poncho played for mosquitos
    and everywhere in between
    well ok we get along
    so what if right now everything wrong
