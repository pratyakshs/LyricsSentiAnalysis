i am checking out
of hotel loneliness
all my lonely days
they are all through
i am checking into
hotel happiness
because darling
i found you
i left my teardrops
in that old lonely room
left my broken heart
back there too
i will not be needing them
in hotel happiness
cause darling i found you
i woke up dreaming of
your crazy kisses
i woke up telling mr misery
here your key cause
i am checking out
of hotel loneliness
no i will not be back
yes it is true
gonna make my new address
at hotel happiness
you know why darling
so glad i found you
no more make my new
address at hotel happiness
cause darling i found you
