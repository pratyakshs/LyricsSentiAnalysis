as i walk along i wonder
awhat went wrong with our love
a love that was so strong

and as i still walk on i think of
the things we have done together
while our hearts were young

i am awalkin in the rain
tears are fallin and i feel the pain
wishin you were here by me
to end this misery

i wonder
i wahwahwahwahwonder
why
why why why why why
she ran away

and i wonder
where she will stay
my little runaway
arun run run run runaway

i am awalkin in the rain
tears are fallin and i feel the pain
wishin you were here by me
to end this misery

and i wonder
i wahwahwahwahwonder
why
why why why why why
she ran away

and i wonder
where she will stay
my little runaway
arun run run run runaway
arun run run run runaway
arun run run run runaway
