sit by my side come as close as the air
and share in a memory of gray
and wander in my words
dream about the pictures that i play of changes

green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
to brown and to yellow they fade
and then they have to die
trapped within the circle time parade of changes

scenes of my young years were warm in my mind
visions of shadows that shine
til one day i returned and found they were
the victims of the vines of changes

the world spinning madly it drifts in the dark
it swings through a hollow of haze
a race around the stars
journey through the universe ablaze with changes

moments of magic will glow in the night
all fears of the forest are gone
but when the morning breaks
they are swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes

passions will part to a strange melody
as fires will sometimes burn cold
like petals in the wind
we are puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes

your tears will be trembling now we are somewhere else
one last cup of wine we will pour
and i will kiss you one more time
and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes

so sit by my side come as close as the air
and share in a memory of gray
and wander in my words
dream about the pictures that i play of changes
