   we will walk hand in hand
   we will walk hand in hand
   we will walk hand in hand some day

   oh deep in my heart

   we shall live in peace
   we shall live in peace
   we shall live in peace some day

   oh deep in my heart

   we shall all be free
   we shall all be free
   we shall all be free some day

   oh deep in my heart

   we are not afraid
   we are not afraid
   we are not afraid today

   oh deep in my heart

   we shall overcome
   we shall overcome
   we shall overcome some day

   oh deep in my heart
   i do believe
   we shall overcome some day
