everybody got to live together
all the people got to understand
so love your neighbour
like you love your brother
come on and join the band

well all you need is love and understanding
ring the bell and let the people know
we are so happy and we are celebrating
come on and let your feelings show

love is all well love is all
love is all can not you hear the call
oh love is all you need
love is all you need at the butterfly ball

ain not you happy that we are all together
at the ball in nature countryside
and although we are wearing different faces
nobody wants to hide

love is all and love is all and
it easy yes it is so easy
at the butterfly ball where love is all
and it is so easy

all you need is love and understanding
ring the bell and let the people know
we are so happy and we are celebrating
let your feelings show

love is all yes love is all at the butterfly ball
love is big love is small
love is free love is all
at the butterfly ball

when your back to the wall
when you are starting to fall
you got something to lean on
love is everything

it can make you sing at the butterfly ball
love is all i say love is all yes love is all
at the butterfly ball
