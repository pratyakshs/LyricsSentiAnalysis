i choose me bristles with pride yes i do
a broom for the shaft and a brush for the flue
up where the smoke is all billered and curled
tween pavement and stars is the chimney sweep world
when there ardly no day nor ardly no night
there things alf in shadow and alfway in light
on the rooftops of london coo what a sight

when you are with a sweep you are in glad company
nowhere is there a more appier crew
than them wot sings chim chim cheree chim cheroo
on the
