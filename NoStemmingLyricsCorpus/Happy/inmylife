there are places i remember
all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life i have loved them all

but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new
though i know i will never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i will often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more

though i know i will never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i will often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more

in my life i love you more
