nights in white satin
       never reaching the end
       letters i have written
       never meaning to send

       beauty i would always missed
       with these eyes before
       just what the truth is
       i can not say anymore

       cause i love you
       yes i love you
       oh how i love you

       gazing at people
       some hand in hand
       just what i am going thru
       they can understand

       some try to tell me
       thoughts they cannot defend
       just what you want to be
       you will be in the end

       and i love you
       yes i love you
       oh how i love you
       oh how i love you

       nights in white satin
       never reaching the end
       letters i have written
       never meaning to send

       beauty i would always missed
       with these eyes before
       just what the truth is
       i can not say anymore

       cause i love you
       yes i love you
       oh how i love you
       oh how i love you

       cause i love you
       yes i love you
       oh how i love you
       oh how i love you
