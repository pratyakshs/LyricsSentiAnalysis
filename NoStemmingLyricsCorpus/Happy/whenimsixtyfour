when i get older losing my hair
many years from now
will you still be sending me a valentine
birthday greetings bottle of wine
if i would been out till quarter to three
would you lock the door
will you still need me will you still feed me
when i am sixtyfour

you will be older too
and if you say the word
i could stay with you

i could be handy mending a fuse
when your lights have gone
you can knit a sweater by the fireside
sunday mornings go for a ride
doing the garden digging the weeds
who could ask for more
will you still need me will you still feed me
when i am sixtyfour

every summer we can rent a cottage in the isle of wight
if it is not too dear
we shall scrimp and save
grandchildren on your knee
vera chuck & dave

send me a postcard drop me a line
stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely wasting away
give me your answer fill in a form
mine for evermore
will you still need me will you still feed me
when i am sixtyfour
