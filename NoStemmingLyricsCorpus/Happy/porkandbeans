they say i need some rogaine to put in my hair
work it out at the gym to fit my underwear
oakley makes the shades to transform a tool
you would hate for the kids to think that you have lost your cool

imma do the things that i wanna do
i is not got a thing to prove to you
i will eat my candy with the pork and beans
excuse my manners if i make a scene
i is not gonna wear the clothes that you like
i am fine and dandy with the me inside
one look in the mirror and i am tickled pink
i do not give a hoot about what you think

everyone likes to dance to a happy song
with a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts
maybe if i work with him i can perfect the art

imma do the things that i wanna do
i is not got a thing to prove to you
i will eat my candy with the pork and beans
excuse my manners if i make a scene
i is not gonna wear the clothes that you like
i am fine and dandy with the me inside
one look in the mirror and i am tickled pink
i do not give a hoot about what you think

no i do not care
i do not care
i do not care
i do not care
i do not care
i do not care

imma do the things that i wanna do
i is not got a thing to prove to you
i will eat my candy with the pork and beans
excuse my manners if i make a scene
i is not gonna wear the clothes that you like
i am fine and dandy with the me inside
one look in the mirror and i am tickled pink
i do not give a hoot about what you think
