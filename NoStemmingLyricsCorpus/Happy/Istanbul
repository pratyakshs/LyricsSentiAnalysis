istanbul was constantinople
now it is istanbul not constantinople
been a long time gone constantinople
now it is turkish delight on a moonlit night

every gal in constantinople
lives in istanbul not constantinople
so if you have a date in constantinople
she will be waiting in istanbul

even old new york was once new amsterdam
why they changed it i can not say
people just liked it better that way

so take me back to constantinople
no you can not go back to constantinople
been a long time gone constantinople
why did constantinople get the works
that nobody business but the turks

istanbul istanbul
