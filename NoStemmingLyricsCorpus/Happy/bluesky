sun is shinin in the sky
there is not a cloud in sight
it stopped rainin
everybody in a play
and do not you know
it a beautiful new day

runnin down the avenuepant pant pant
see how the sun shines brightly
in the city on the streets
where once was pity
mr blue sky is living here today

chorus]
mr blue sky please tell us why
you had to hide away
for so long where did we go wrong

hey there mr blue
we are so pleased to be with you
look around see what you do
everybody smiles at you

hey you with the pretty face
welcome to the human race
a celebration mr blue skys
up there waitin and today
is the day we have waited for

chorus]

mr blue you did it right
but soon comes mr night
creepin over now his
hand is on your shoulder
never mind i will remember you this way
