wise men say only fools rush in
but i can not help falling in love with you
shall i stay
would it be a sin
if i can not help falling in love with you

like a river flows surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand take my whole life too
for i can not help falling in love with you

like a river flows surely to the sea
darling so it goes
some things are meant to be
take my hand take my whole life too
for i can not help falling in love with you
for i can not help falling in love with you
