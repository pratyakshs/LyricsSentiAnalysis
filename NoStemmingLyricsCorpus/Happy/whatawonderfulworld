i see trees of green
red roses too
i see them bloom
for me and you
and i think to myself
what a wonderful world

i see skies of blue
and clouds of white
the bright blessed day
the dark sacred night
and i think to myself
what a wonderful world

the colors of the rainbow
so pretty in the sky
are also on the faces
of people going by
i see friends shaking hands
saying how do you do
they are really saying
i love you

i hear babies cry
i watch them grow
they will learn much more
than i will ever know
and i think to myself
what a wonderful world

yes i think to myself
what a wonderful world

oh yeah
