all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
i have been for a walk on a winter day
i would be safe and warm if i was in la
california dreamin on such a winter day

stopped in to a church i passed along the way
well i got down on my knees and i pretend to pray
you know the preacher liked the cold
he knows i am gonna stay
california dreamin on such a winter day

all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
i have been for a walk on a winter day
if i didn not tell her i could leave today
california dreamin on such a winter day
california dreamin on such a winter day
california dreamin on such a winter day
