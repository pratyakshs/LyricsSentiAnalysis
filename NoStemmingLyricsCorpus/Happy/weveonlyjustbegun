we have only just begun to live
    white lace and promises
    a kiss for luck and we are on our way
    we have just begun

    before the rising sun we fly
    so many roads to choose
    we start out walking and learn to run
    and yes we have just begun

    sharing horizons that are new to us
    watching the signs along the way
    talking it over just the two of us
    working together day to day
    together

    and when the evening comes we smile
    so much of life ahead
    we will find a place where there room to grow
    and yes we have just begun
