oh i marched to the battle of new orleans
at the end of the early british war
the young land started growing
the young blood started flowing
but i is not marchin anymore

for i have killed my share of indians
in a thousand different fights
i was there at the little big horn
i heard many men lying i saw many more dying
but i is not marchin anymore

it always the old to lead us to the war
it always the young to fall
now look at all we have won with the saber and the gun
tell me is it worth it all

for i stole california from the mexican land
fought in the bloody civil war
yes i even killed my brothers
and so many others but i is not marchin anymore

for i marched to the battles of the german trench
in a war that was bound to end all wars
oh i must have killed a million men
and now they want me back again
but i is not marchin anymore



    for i flew the final mission in the japanese sky
    set off the mighty mushroom roar
    when i saw the cities burning i knew that i was learning
    that i is not marchin anymore

    now the labor leader screamin
    when they close the missile plants
    united fruit screams at the cuban shore
    call it peace or call it treason
    call it love or call it reason
    but i is not marchin any more
    no i is not marchin any more
