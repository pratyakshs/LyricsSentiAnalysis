so happy together

imagine me and you i do
i think about you day and night it is only right
to think about the girl you love and hold her tight
so happy together

if i should call you up invest a dime
and you say you belong to me and ease my mind
imagine how the world could be so very fine
so happy together

i can not see me lovin nobody but you
for all my life
when you are with me baby the skies will be blue
for all my life

me and you and you and me
no matter how they toss the dice it has to be
the only one for me is you and you for me
so happy together

i can not see me lovin nobody but you
for all my life
when you are with me baby the skies will be blue
for all my life

me and you and you and me
no matter how they toss the dice it has to be
the only one for me is you and you for me
so happy together

me and you and you and me
no matter how they toss the dice it has to be
the only one for me is you and you for me
so happy together

so happy together
how is the weather
so happy together
we are happy together
so happy together
happy together
so happy together
so happy together
