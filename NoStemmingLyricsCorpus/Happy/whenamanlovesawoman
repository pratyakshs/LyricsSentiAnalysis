when a man loves a woman
can not keep his mind on nothin else
he would trade the world
for a good thing he is found
if she is bad he can not see it
she can do no wrong
turn his back on his best friend
if he puts her down

when a man loves a woman
spend his very last dime
trying to hold on to what he needs
he would give up all his comforts
and sleep out in the rain
if she said that the way
it ought to be

when a man loves a woman
i give you everything i got yeah
    trying to hold on
    to your precious love
    baby please do not treat me bad

    when a man loves a woman
    deep down in his soul
    she can bring him such misery
    if she is playing him for a fool
    he is the last one to know
    loving eyes can never see

    yes when a man loves a woman
    i know exactly how he feels
    cause baby baby baby
    i am a man
    when a man loves a woman
