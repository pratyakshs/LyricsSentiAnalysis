deep down louisiana close to new orleans
     way back up in the woods among the evergreens
     there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
     where lived a country boy named of johnny b goode
     who never ever learned to read or write so well
     but he could play the guitar like ringing a bell

     go go
     go johnny go
     go go
     johnny b goode

     he use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
     or sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
     oh the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade
     strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
     the people passing by they would stop and say
     oh my that little country boy could play


     go go
     go johnny go
     go go
     johnny b goode

     his mother told him someday you will be a man
     and you would be the leader of a big old band
     many people coming from miles around
     to hear you play your music when the sun go down
     maybe someday your name will be in lights
     saying johnny b goode tonight

     go go
     go johnny go
     go go
     johnny b goode
