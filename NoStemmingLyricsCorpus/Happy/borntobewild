get your motor runnin
head out on the highway
lookin for adventure
and whatever comes our way
yeah darlin go make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

i like smoke and lightning
heavy metal thunder
racin with the wind
and the feelin that i am under
yeah darlin go make it happen
take the world in a love embrace
fire all of your guns at once
and explode into space

like a true nature child
we were born born to be wild
we can climb so high
i never wanna die

born to be wild
born to be wild
