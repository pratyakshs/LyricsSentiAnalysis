you who are on the road must have a code that you can live by
and so become yourself because the past is just a good bye
teach your children well their father hell did slowly go by
      and feed them on your dreams the one they fix the one you will know by
      do not you ever ask them why if they told you you would cry
      so just look at them and sigh and know they love you

      and you of the tender years can not know the fears that your elders grew by
      and so please help them with your youth they seek the truth before they can die
      teach your parents well their children hell will slowly go by
      and feed them on your dreams the one they fixthe one you will know by
      do not you ever ask them why if they told you you would cry
      so just look at them and sigh and know they love you
