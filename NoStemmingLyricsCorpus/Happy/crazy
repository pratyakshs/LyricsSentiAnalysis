crazy
i am crazy for feeling so lonely
i am crazy
crazy for feeling so blue
i knew you would love me as long as you wanted
and then some day
you would leave me for somebody new

worry
why do i let myself worry
wondering
what in the world did i do

oh crazy
for thinking that my love could hold you
i am crazy for trying
and crazy for crying
and i am crazy for loving you

crazy for thinking that my love could hold you
i am crazy for trying
and crazy for crying
and i am crazy for loving
you
