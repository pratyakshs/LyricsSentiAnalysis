to lead a better life i need a love of my own
here
    making each day of the year
    changing my life with a wave of her hand
    nobody can deny that there something there
    i want her everywhere
    and if she is beside me i know i need never care
    but to love her is to meet her everywhere
    knowing that love is to share
    each one believing that love never dies
    watching her eyes and hoping i am always there
    i will be here there and everywhere
    here there and everywhere
