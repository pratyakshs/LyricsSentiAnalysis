left a good job in the city
workin for the man every night and day
but i never lost a minute of sleepin
worryin bout the way things might have been

big wheel keep on turnin
proud mary keep on burnin
rollin rollin rollin on the river

cleaned a lot of plates in memphis
pumped a lot of tane down in new orleans
but i never saw the good side of a city
til i hitched a ride on the riverboat queen

big wheel keep on turnin
proud mary keep on burnin
rollin rollin rollin on the river


if you come down to the river
bet you are gonna find some people who live
you do not have to worry cause you have no money
people on the river are happy to give

big wheel keep on turnin
proud mary keep on burnin
rollin rollin rollin on the river
