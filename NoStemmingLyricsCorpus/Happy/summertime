some people wind up
with the one that they adore
in a heartshaped hotel room
it what a heart is for
the bubble floats so madly
will it stay skyhigh
hello partner kiss your name byebye
ooh sometimes

romantic piscean seeks angel in disguise
chinesespeaking girlfriend big brown eyes
liverpudlian lady sophisticated male
hello partner tell me love can not fail

and it is you and me in the summertime
we will be handinhand down in the park
with a squeeze and a sigh
and that twinkle in your eye
and all the sunshine banishes the dark

some people wind up
with the one that they abhor
in a distant hellhole room
this third world war
but all i see is films where a colourless despair
meant angry young men with immaculate hair
ooh sometimes

get up a voice inside says
there no time for looking down
only a pound a word
and you are talking to the town
and how do you coin the phrase though
that will set your soul apart
just to touch a lonely heart

and it is you and me in the summertime
we will be handinhand down in the park
with a squeeze and a sigh
and the twinkle in your eye
and all the sunshine banishes the dark

and it is you i need in the summertime
as i turn my white skin red
two peas from the same pod yes we are
or have i read too much fiction
is this how it happens

how does it happen
how does it happen
how does it happen
is this how it happens
