oh my love my darling
i have hungered for your touch
a long lonely time
time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine
i need your love
i need your love
god speed your love to me

lonely rivers flow
to the sea to the sea
to the open arms of the sea
lonely rivers sigh
wait for me wait for me
i will be coming home wait for me

oh my love my darling
i have hungered for your touch
a long lonely time
time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine
i need your love
i need your love
god speed your love to me
lonely mountains gaze
at the stars at the stars
waiting for the dawn of the day

all alone i gaze
at the stars at the stars
dreaming of my love far away

oh my love my darling
i have hungered for your touch
a long lonely time
time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine
i need your love
i need your love
god speed your love to me
