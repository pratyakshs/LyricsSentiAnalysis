burning in the skies



i used the deadwood to make the fire rise

the blood of innocence burning in the skies

i filled my cup with the rising of the sea

and poured it out in an ocean of debris



i am swimming in the smoke

of bridges i have burned

so don not apologize

i am losing what i don not deserve

what i don not deserve



we held our breath when the clouds began to form

but you were lost in the beating of the storm

and in the end we were made to be apart

in separate chambers of the human heart



i am swimming in the smoke

of bridges i have burned

so don not apologize

i am losing what i don not deserve



it in the blackened bones

of bridges i have burned

so don not apologize

i am losing what i don not deserve

what i don not deserve



i am swimming in the smoke

of bridges i have burned

so don not apologize

i am losing what i don not deserve



the blame is mine alone

for bridges i have burned

so don not apologize

i am losing what i don not deserve



what i don not deserve

what i don not deserve

what i don not deserve



and here the dead wood to make the fire rise

the blood of innocence burning in the skies
