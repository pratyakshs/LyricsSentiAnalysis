use your fist and not your mouth



come on come on 

come on come on 



i am overground outselling it

since god thinks i don not exist 

the beatings happen per minute

this is not blue collar white corrective politics 

i am on an hate american style kick 



this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 

this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 



i am on a campaign for pain 

and when i get elected 

i will wipe the white off your house 

the smile off your face 



this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 

this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 



i woke up today and wished for tomorrow 

i don not want to be like anyone else 

i woke up today and wished for tomorrow 

i don not want even be myself 



i said no this isn not your song 

we can not all get along 

it too hard to hold hands when your hands are fists 

my hate pop won not ever stop 

i am fucking glad we are different 

this is my hate american style 

hit



don not bring 

don not sing it 

use your fist and not your mouth 



this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 

this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 



this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 

this is the black collar song 

put it in your middle finger and sing along 

use your fist and not your mouth 

come on come on come on come on 



i woke up today and wished for tomorrow 

i don not want to be like anyone else 

i woke up today and wished for tomorrow 

i don not want even be myself
