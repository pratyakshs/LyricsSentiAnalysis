boys shoot to thrill from the hip this time we put the act in action

we have tricked the pigs into thinking that this auction is a pageant

in no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery

the livestock is star struck they are all salivating like ravenous cartoons

goddamn animal you would better watch where you spit

squeal like soft music if it helps we will dim the lights on the floor

neon bulbs are the cosmetics of swine

everybody looks quite dazzling trussed up in their formal attire

you would make a great secret if i could keep you but we all spill our guts

we are locked and loaded drip fed and bloated

our trigger fingers snagged in the mouse trap of the moment

turn the lights off on us like a moth left in the cold in the dark begging for more

when the urgency strikes you you would better not lose your nerve

it the rush that the cockroaches get at the end of the world it is alright

there a pail by the bed if you need one but you are doing just fine

when in rome we shall do as the romans when in hell we do shots at the bar

last call kill it

we do not think in terms of the morning afters and we do not utter a single word of the night before

in the meantime we are just thoughtless incessant buzzing apparatus

disillusioned and lonelier than the last man standing it doesn not get any better than this so run like hell

this is a rock and roll takeover

living each day one night at a time

there were mercy fucks there was blood

you should have been there by my side

this is passion this is red handed denial

i have no lover and she hasn not the prettiest eyes last call kill it
