away from me



yea lies



look at me now 

just sittin here by myself

and i think you found someone else

now i am gonna have to find 

a way to put the bottle down

and why can’t you see

that i’m drowning in a pool of misery



i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid

that you’re lost in somebody

i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid 

that you’re lost



so here i am 

i do not wanna be by myself

and i think you’re fucking someone else

now im gonna have to find a way

to take the knife out of my back

and how could you leave me

stranded in a closet full of bones



i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid

that you’re lost in somebody

i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid 

that you’re lost



maybe you could let me stay

maybe just for one more day

you could help me stay the same

maybe things won’t ever change

maybe we could taste the rain

you could push me out the way



now i sit here by myself

think about somebody else

how could you let them take you away from me

there’s somebody else

there’s somebody else



i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid

that you’re lost in somebody

i’m always afraid

that you’re gone

away from me

i’m always afraid 

that you’re
