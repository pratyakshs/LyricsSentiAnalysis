dyers eve



dear mother

dear father

what is this hell you have put me through

believer

deceiver

day in day out live my life through you

pushed onto me what wrong or right

hidden from this thing that they call life

dear mother

dear father

every thought i would think you would disapprove

curator

dictator

always censoring my every move

children are seen but are not heard

tear out everything inspired



innocence

torn from me without your shelter

barred reality

i am living blindly



dear mother

dear father

time has frozen still what left to be

hear nothing

say nothing

cannot face the fact i think for me

no guaranteeit life as is

but damn you for not giving me my chance

dear mother

dear father

you have clipped my wings before i learned to fly

unspoiled

unspoken

i have outgrown that fucking lullaby

same thing i have always heard from you

do as i say not as i do



innocence

torn from me without your shelter

barred reality

i am living blindly

i am in hell without you

cannot cope without you two

shocked at the world that i see

innocent victim please rescue me



dear mother

dear father

hidden in your world you have made for me

i am seething

i am bleeding

ripping wounds in me that never heal

undying spite i feel for you

living out this hell you always knew
