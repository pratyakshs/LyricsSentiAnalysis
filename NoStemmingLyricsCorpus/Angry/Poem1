standing in selfhatred
drowning in my tears
looking back on my life
what i have been through the past 18 years
living in my brother shadow
everything i do and say
wishing somehow things would change
praying for a way
same old crap just another day
living this evil life that was created just for me
starving for love affection and attention
i know none of this is how it is really supposed to be
i try to be strong
even though i feel so weak
feel like just giving up
but i will not accept that level of defeat
pretend like i am always happy
although i am never really okay
waiting for this pain to end
that i feel every stupid day
it hard to say what wrong
when nothings going right
hard to keep myself going
when i have been blinded by sight
this pain is never ending
it just goes on and on and on
it all so unbelievably real
i just wish it all was gone
trying to pick myself up
when i have fallen so far and hard
but i do not know where i am going
it all so very dark
my heart is weak my emotions sore
i do my best to never let it show
but deep down inside i feel like
i am dying and nobody knows
a lot of messed up thoughts
run through my head constantly
i just wish i didn not live
this life of misery
