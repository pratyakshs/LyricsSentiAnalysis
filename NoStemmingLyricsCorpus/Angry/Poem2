dear mom
you said you would always be there
but you are nowhere to be found
i can not believe you left me
i feel so low beneath the ground

there nothing i can do now
i trusted you with all my heart
but now you are gone
you are the one who tore my life apart

i have learned not to trust
there nothing more to say
you have lost someone special
you can not get back each day

now you are the one left in the dark
and all of a sudden you feel my pain
you expect me to take you back
but you still feel you are not to blame

i could never forgive you
even if i tried
you can never make up
for the lonely nights i have cried

you will never know the feeling
of losing the person you need the most
to laugh and cry and love you
instead of making you feel like a ghost

i have moved on with my life
without you by my side
my pain has kept so long
i am telling you how i feel inside

in a way i want to thank you
because of you i am strong
i just wanted you to know
i didn not turn out wrong
