platypus i hate you



your rise and fall

back up against the wall

what goes around is coming back and haunting you

it time to quit

cause you is not worth the shit

under my shoes or the piss on the ground



no one loves you and you know it

don not pretend that you enjoy it or you don not care

cause now i wouldn not lie or tell you all the things you want

to hear

cause i hate you

cause i hate you

cause i hate you

cause i hate you



i heard you are sick

sucked on that cancer stick

a throbbing tumor and a radiation high

shit out of luck

and now your time is up

it brings me pleasure just to know you are going to die



dickhead fuckface cock smoking mother fucking asshole

dirty twat waste of semen i hope you die hey



red eye code blue

i would like to strangle you

and watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull

when you go down

head first into the ground

i will stand above you just to piss on your grave
