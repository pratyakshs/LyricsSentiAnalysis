stockholm syndrome



i won not stand in your way

let your hatred grow

and she will scream

and she will shout

and she will pray

and she had a name

yeah she had a name



and i won not hold you back

let your anger rise

and we will fly

and we will fall

and we will burn

no one will recall

no one will recall



this is the last time i will abandon you

and this is the last time i will forget you

i wish i could



look to the stars

let hope grow in your eyes

and we will love

and we will hate

and we will die

all to no avail

all to no avail



this is the last time i will abandon you

and this is the last time i will forget you

i wish i could



this is the last time i will abandon you

and this is the last time i will forget you

i wish i could

i wish i could
