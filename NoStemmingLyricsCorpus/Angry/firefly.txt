firefly



you my friend

you are a lot like them

but i caught your lie

and you know i did

now i am lost in you

like i always do

and i would die to win

cause i am born to lose



firefly

could you shine your light

now i know your ways

cause they are just like mine

now i am justified

as i fall in line

and it is hard to try

when you are open wide



take my hand

we will be off and then

we will come back again

to a different land

now i like this way

you can go away

if you guess the name

you cannot replace



bring me your enemies

lay them before me

and walk away



fuck you firefly

have you lost your light

now i hate your ways

cause they are just like mine

so you lost my friend

such a sorry end

and i don not know why

so i choke and smile
