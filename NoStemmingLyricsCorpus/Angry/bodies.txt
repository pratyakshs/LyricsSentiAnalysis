bodies



let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floooooor 

beaten why for why for

can not take much more

here we go

here we go

here we go

one  nothing wrong with me

two  nothing wrong with me

three  nothing wrong with me

four  nothing wrong with me



one  something got to give

two  something got to give

three  something got to give

now

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the flooooor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the flooooor

now

push me again

this is the end

here we go

here we go

here we go

one  nothing wrong with me

two  nothing wrong with me

three  nothing wrong with me

four  nothing wrong with me

one  something got to give

two  something got to give

three  something got to give

now

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the flooooor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

skin against skin blood and bone

you are all by yourself but you are not alone

you wanted in now you are here

driven by hate 

consumed by fear

let the bodies hit the floor 

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floooooooor

one  nothing wrong with me

two  nothing wrong with me

three  nothing wrong with me

four  nothing wrong with me

one  something got to give

two  something got to give

three  something got to give

now

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the flooooor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor

let the bodies hit the floor
