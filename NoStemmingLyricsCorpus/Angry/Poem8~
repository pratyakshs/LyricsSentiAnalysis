leaving behind others to take your place
carrying on your name walking around with your face
knowing you got left behind
wondering what on my father mind
he didn not even think to try
to leave my mother with tears going down her face
left me only to embrace
only for me to ask her why
my mother can give me answers
my father left behind
for he can give his love to another
but can not give his love to me
my mother would give her life
as she is given life to me
my father i hope to love
will he ever really love me
he can take and make a life and keep living on
but what is it like to live without a father
he doesn not even know
because he doesn not even care
he left me alone
