note back with a classic what you lookin so shocked for

you knew that this was comin bitch turn up your speakers

i burn thru the heaters the type to spit flames at the sun

and put it out  put it simply i am hot bitch

lasmosis on the track no time and the bets off

take shots turn that gun around and blow your own heads off

cause bitch i will keep comin like i am nikes in sweat shops

i ride this track till the wheels crack motherfuck a rest stop

hit you in the back with the beat so hard you brace from it

say nothin or face someone in a league of their own

irobot sunnysonny take a seat you a clone

i forgot others want a seat on the throne

but i won not let anybody beat me to home base

i am so hot baby this the right time in the wrong place

rap on dubstep bitch i kill it like road rage

pause no way honey my best friends success

and i am about to let this motherfucker lead the way



heavy shit  never quit

heaven sent  you scared of it

think that you prepared to spit embarrassment

is all you will ever get you a pussy i am the rapist call me therapist~



tell me someone else you know like me who spits it similar

two hits of ritalin this is me calmed down

first class flight and i am pullin the bombs out

like me against the world motherfucker fuck peace i want war now

loose lips and i am pulling your jaw out

back on my sick shit in my basement as i fritzl your grandkids

leave shit stains all over your damn crib

like cartman redecorated fuck keep me medicated

no sleep in seven days kids reaching for my level

never level headed when my foots down

you can not reach the pedal

played like jipetto this isn not the pot calling all you kettles black

how you critique my skills when all you have said is wack

and when all is said and done

you have done nothing that you said you could have done

rap industry or you  who you think really won

most of us are really dumb

no scratch that tear out your teeth and your tongue

you fucking heard me cunt i want you really dumb haaaaaah





strapped with these insanities my rage is influenced 

by pages and pages of music took me ages to do it

now check what other rappers say and it is putrid

get on stage and they are stupid

the games dying cause the players are useless

yes to staying dated saying nay to the new shit

you want to be an animal that why you are caged in the booth bitch

chained to the ways of jumping thru hoops just to say you can do shit

like bust guns you are the reason why i pray for this music

every track you ever lay getting muted

every stack you ever make probably getting recouped

why can not you just stay true to the music

before i taser you fluids pumped through your veins from a tube

not on the same page you looking lame like road rage in a buick

you got bars but come and see my cage when i lure you

backstage you are trapped  wait here till i get back with the chainsaw

and leave your brains all dangling from his neck while his head barely hangs on

i knew it but wouldn not say

i was hoping that you would learn from mistakes

but you are bewitched so you can burn at the stake

when i get on stage i take my soul and i put it to 110%

you can not do it you are just lazy you are thru with

embrace change i am insane but i use it

all the pain and the weight upon my shoulders is broadway on my loose leaf

say i am fake bitch i say i am the truest

i create from the heart

you can laugh but i know i can do it

you are gone
