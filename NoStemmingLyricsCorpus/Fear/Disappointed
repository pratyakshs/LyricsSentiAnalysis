my papa says i am great
my hair is curly but i like it straight
i do not go on no dates
my mama says i am better than them anyway

i am not mad at no one else
just disappointed in myself
and i do not care if no one can tell
i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i do not like my big face
cause nothing in this earth needs that much space
don not like the dark thoughts in my mind
they make me feel so bad all the time

i am not mad at no one else
just disappointed in myself
and i do not care if no one can tell
i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i am not mad at no one else
just disappointed in myself
and i do not care if no one can tell
i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

help feed the homeless
well help the insecure
help me find out if i am dirty or if i am pure
cause i am trying to figure out who i am supposed to be
do i deserve to go on happily

i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i am not mad at no one else
just disappointed in myself
and i do not care if no one can tell
cause i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i am not mad at no one else
just disappointed in myself
and i do not care if no one can tell
i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i am not mad at no one else wish on wishing wells
just disappointed in myself they do not work so what the hell
and i do not care if no one can tell
cause i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell

i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the hell
i do not wish on wishing wells
cause they do not work so what the
