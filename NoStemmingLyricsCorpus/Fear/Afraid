what they say what they say what they say

you speak out all you feel is defiance
all you need is some selfreliance
cause this world is gonna always try us
and all you wanted was to run for cover
well here looking to yourself and no other
we are all searching for that special something
and we keep on running

we all have the choice to take the lead or follow
i want to feel the light shine on me

you are so afraid of what people might say
but that okay cause you are only human
you are so afraid of what people might say
but that okay you will soon get strong enough
you are so afraid of what people might say
but that okay cause you are only human
you are so afraid of what people might say
you are going to break
so please do not do it

you wanna spread your wings but you are not sure
don not wanna leave your comforts
wanna find a cure
we are afraid of who we see in the mirror
we wanna let go but it feels too pure
who wants to be alone in this world
you look around and all you see is hurt
but the light it always finds us
if we move with a little trust

a diamond do not define what shine is
i do not need a rolex to know what the time is
you got your let me find what mine is
i am a survivor look how strong my mind is
i stand on my own it is all me
regardless of whatever they call me

i am a leader not a follower
and i would rather be paid and popular
ride homie get your dollars up
we are in the belly of the beast that already swallowed us
