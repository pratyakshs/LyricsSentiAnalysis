they speak of love and tolerance
they thrive on people ignorance
to make you all slaves of fear

they feed on your anxiety
to build their dead society
they have kept you down for a thousand years

they nurture prejudice and hate
condemn the wars that they create
in the name of whatever god

they gladly sacrifice your lives
increasing power is their prize
without regrets they will spill your blood

they are feeding you lies
with calculating smiles
enslavement of the human mind
as long as you kneel to their authority
religion is what makes you blind

they are treating you as mindless fools
and use you as obedient tools
it time to set your spirit free

this world we cannot tolerate
it time to seal all preachers fate
and let them hang from oden tree

they are feeding you lies
with calculating smiles
enslavement of the human mind
as long as you kneel to their authority
religion is what makes you blind

your minds are restrained
obedience is the chain
they have locked you up and thrown away the key
your souls are for sale
and you are the ones who pay
but still you will never be set free
