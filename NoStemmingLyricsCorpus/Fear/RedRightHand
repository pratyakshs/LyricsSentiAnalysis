take a little walk to the edge of town
and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms
like a bird of doom
as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the border fires
in the humming wires
hey man you know
you are never coming back
past the square past the bridge
past the mills past the stacks
on a gathering storm comes
a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with
a red right hand

he will wrap you in his arms
tell you that you have been a good boy
he will rekindle all the dreams
it took you a lifetime to destroy
he will reach deep into the hole
heal your shrinking soul
but there will not be a single thing
that you can do
he a god he is a man
he a ghost he is a guru
they are whispering his name
through this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat
is a red right hand

you do not have no money
he will get you some
you do not have no car 
he will get you one
you do not have no selfrespect
you feel like an insect
well do not you worry buddy
cause here he comes
through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his
red right hand

you will see him in your nightmares
you will see him in your dreams
he will appear out of nowhere but
he is not what he seems
you will see him in your head
on the tv screen
and hey buddy i am warning
you to turn it off
he a ghost he is a god
he a man he is a guru
you are one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by
his red right hand
