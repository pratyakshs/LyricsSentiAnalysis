then i am radio and then i am television
i am afraid of everyone i am afraid of everyone
lay the young blue bodies with the old red bodies
i am afraid of everyone i am afraid of everyone
with my kid on my shoulders i try
not to hurt anybody i like
but i do not have the drugs to sort
i do not have the drugs to sort it out sort it out

i defend my family with my orange umbrella
i am afraid of everyone i am afraid of everyone
with my shiny new starspangled tennis shoes on
i am afraid of everyone i am afraid of everyone
with my kid on my shoulders i try
not to hurt anybody i like
but i do not have the drugs to sort 
i do not have the drugs to sort it out sort it out
i do not have the drugs to sort it out sort it out

little voices swallowing my soul soul soul
