the ants are in the sugar
the muscles atrophied
we are on the other side the screen is us and we are tv
spread me open
sticking to my pointy ribs
are all your infants in abortion cribs
i was born into this
everything turns to shit
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear
pray until your number
asleep from all your pain
your apple has been rotting
tomorrow turned up dead
i have it all and i have no choice but to
i will make everyone pay and you will see
you can kill yourself now
because you are dead
in my mind
the boy that you loved is the monster you fear
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
you have poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
pray unto the splinters pray unto your fear
pray your life was just a dream
the cut that never heals
pray now baby pray your life was just a dream
i am so tangled in my sins that i cannot escape
pinch the head off collapse me like a weed
someone had to go this far
i was born into this
everything turns to shit
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark
you have poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
pray unto the splinters pray unto your fear
pray your life was just a dream
the cut that never heals
pray now baby pray your life was just a dream
the world in my hands there no one left to hear you scream
there no one left for you

when all of your wishes are granted many of your dreams will be destroyed
