i scare myself just thinking about you
i scare myself when i am without you
i scare myself the moment that you are gone
i scare myself and i let my thoughts run
and when they are running
i keep thinking of you
and when they are running
what can i do
i scare myself and i do not mean lightly
i scare myself it can get frightening
i scare myself to think what i could do
i scare myself  it is some kind of voodoo
and with that voodoo
i keep thinking of you
and with that voodoo
what can i do
but it is so so very different when we are together
and i am so so so much calmer i feel better
cause the stars already crossed our paths forever
and the sooner that you realise it the better
and then i will be with you and i will not scare myself
and i will know what to do and i will not scare myself
and my thoughts will run and i will not scare myself
and i will think of you and i will not scare myself
it me i am scaring
