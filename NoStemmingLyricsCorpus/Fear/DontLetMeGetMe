i can not take direction and my socks are never
clean

its bad when you annoy yourself 
so irritating 
don not wanna be my friend no more 
i wanna be somebody else

don not let me get me 
i am my own worst enemy 
its bad when you annoy yourself 
so irritating 
don not wanna be my friend no more 
i wanna be somebody else 

doctor doctor will not you please prescribe
