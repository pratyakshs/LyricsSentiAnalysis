i am a rabbit in your headlights
scared of the spotlight
you do not come to visit
i am stuck in this bed

thin rubber gloves
she laughs when she is cryin
she cries when she is laughin

fat bloody fingers
are suckin your soul
away away away
away away

i am a rabbit in your headlights
christian suburbanite
washed down the toilet
money to burn

fat bloody fingers
are sucking your soul
away

{if you are frightened of dyin and and you are holdin on
you will see devils tearin your life away
but if you have made your peace
then the devils are really angels
freeing you from the earth from the earth from the earth

rot worms on the underground
caught between stations
butterfingers
i am losin my patience

i am a rabbit in your headlights
christian suburbanite
you got money to burn

fat bloody fingers
are sucking your soul
away

away away away
away away away
