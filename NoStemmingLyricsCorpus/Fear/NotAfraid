i am not afraid i am not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
we will walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just letting you know that you are not alone
holler if you feel like you have been down the same road same road

yeah it is been a ride
i guess i had to go to that place to get to this one
now some of you might still be in that place
if you are trying to get out just follow me
i will get you there

you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay em
but you will not take the sting out these words before i say em
cause is not no way ima let you stop me from causing mayhem
when i say ima do something i do it
i do not give a damn what you think
i am doing this for me so fuck the world
feed it beans it is gassed up if it thinks it is stopping me
ima be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me i am tearing down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts do not try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album
he still shitting whether he is on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
he married to the game like a fuck you for christmas
his gift is a curse forget the earth he is got the urge
to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

okay quit playing with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldn not have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it is a rap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth for that
fuck your fillings instead of getting crowned you are getting capped
and to the fans i will never let you down again i am back
i promise to never go back on that promise in fact
let be honest that last relapse cd was ehhh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i is not going back to that now
all i am trying to say is get back clickclack blow
cause i is not playing around
it a game called circle and i do not know how i am way too up to back down
but i think i am still trying to figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didnt this fucking black cloud
still follows me around but it is time to exorcise these demons
these motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now

and i just can not keep living this way
so starting today i am breaking out of this cage
i am standing up ima face my demons
i am manning up ima hold my ground
i have had enough now i am so fed up
time to put my life back together right now now

it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally
for you so i could come back a brand new me you helped see me through
and do not even realize what you did cause believe me you
i been through the ringer but they could do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldn not lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel i am strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause i am raising the bar
i would shoot for the moon but i am too busy gazing at stars
i feel amazing and im
