little girl with the press and curl
age eight i got a jheri curl
thirteen and i got a relaxer
i was a source of so much laughter
at fifteen when it all broke off
eighteen and went all natural
february two thousand and two
i went on and did
what i had to do
because it was time to change my life
to become the women that i am inside
ninetyseven dreadlocks all gone
i looked in the mirror
for the first time and saw that hey

i am not my hair
i am not this skin
i am not your expectations no no
i am not my hair
i am not this skin
i am a soul that lives within

what would she do to her hair i do not know it look crazy
i like it i might do that
umm i would not go that far i know  ha ha ha ha

good hair means curls and waves
bad hair means you look like a slave
at the turn of the century
its time for us to redefine who we be
you can shave it off
like a south african beauty
or get in on lock
like bob marley
you can rock it straight
like oprah winfrey
if its not what on your head
its what underneath and say hey

whoa whoa whoa
does the way i wear my hair make me a better person
whoa whoa whoa
does the way i wear my hair make me a better friend oh
whoa whoa whoa
does the way i wear my hair determine my integrity
whoa whoa whoa
i am expressing my creativity
whoa whoa whoa

breast cancer and chemotherapy
took away her crown and glory
she promised god if she was to survive
she would enjoy everyday of her life ooh
on national television
her diamond eyes are sparkling
bald headed like a full moon shining
singing out to the whole wide world like hey

if i wanna shave it close
or if i wanna rock locks
that do not take a bit away
from the soul that i got
dat da da dat da 4x]
if i wanna where it braided
all down my back
i do not see what wrong with that
dat da da dat da 4x]
