i took my love i took it down
climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
till the landslide brought me down

oh mirror in the sky what is love
can the child within my heart rise above
can i sail through the changing ocean tides
can i handle the seasons of my life
mmm mmm mmm

well i have been afraid of changing
cause i have built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older and i am getting older too

well i have been afraid of changing
cause i have built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older and i am getting older too
oh i am getting older too

awh take my love take it down
awh climb a mountain and turn around
and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide bring it down

and if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
well the landslide bring it down
oh the landslide bring it down
