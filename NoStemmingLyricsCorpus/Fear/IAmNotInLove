i am not in love
so do not forget it
it just a silly phase i am going through
and just because
i call you up
don not get me wrong do not think you have got it made
i am not in love no no it is because 

i like to see you
but then again
that doesn not mean you mean that much to me
so if i call you
don not make a fuss
don not tell your friends about the two of us
i am not in love no no it is because 

i keep your picture
upon the wall
it hides a nasty stain that lying there 
so do not you ask me
to give it back 
i know you know it doesn not mean that much to me
i am not in love no no it is because 

ooh you will wait a long time for me
ooh you will wait a long time
ooh you will wait a long time for me
ooh you will wait a long time 

i am not in love
so do not forget it
it just a silly phase i am going through
and just because i call you up
don not get me wrong do not think you have got it made
i am not in love
i am not in love
