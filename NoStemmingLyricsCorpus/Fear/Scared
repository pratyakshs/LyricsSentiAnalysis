what your favourite scary movie

i have walked the jungle fought a lion with bare hands 
the prince of darkness i am a far better man 
i have walked the dessert never feared for my own 
where lightning strikes i will always go

eye of the tiger not afraid to attack like frankenstein flat on my back 
that witch magic took nothing from me 
cos you are the one whose gotta spell over me

if you are looking for danger here i come you would better look out it is just begun 
there something that i want you to know 
one thing that i am scared of is losing hold of you 
get these shivers down my spine feel my body turning blue 
the feeling is so frightening it is driving me insane 
one thing that i am scared of
is losing hold of you

the terminator said he will be back fight fire with fire that a natural fact 
tell me your nightmare i will give you my dream 
i will protect you whenever you scream

if you are looking for danger here i come you would better look out it is just begun 
there something that i want you to know 
one thing that i am scared of is losing hold of you 
get these shivers down my spine feel my body turning blue 
the feeling is so frightening it is driving me insane 
one thing that i am scared of
is losing hold of you 
i could have swore i heard her screaming

because you are always there to let me know 
sometimes we all get scared i am telling you i can not let you go oh

while chorus is going second time round]
i can feel it in the air and my fever going down 
there a chill across the town uhohoohhoh

one thing that i am scared of is losing hold of you 
i get these shivers down my spine feel my body turning blue 
the feeling is so frightening it is driving me insane 
one thing that i am scared of
is losing hold of you
