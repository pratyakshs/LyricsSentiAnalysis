we ordered up one more bottle of wine
you told me your story i thought about mine
you said when you lost her you lost everything
it all started having a familiar ring

so i asked you to take me some place quiet
we wound up at the river for the rest of the night
somewhere around the break of day
i could hear it coming from a mile away

so do not say that word
not the one we both heard too much
you may think you do but you dont
it just the fear of being alone

reckless hearts can clear a path
wider than a hurricane aftermath
we have both traveled down that road
where in the name of love anything goes

so do not say that word
not the one we both heard too much
you may think you do but you dont
it just the fear of being alone

like a child in the night
with no one to hold you
and tell you everything gonna be all right

i must admit it is been fun
but that no reason to jump the gun
if this is real time will tell
so let me bite my tongue and remind myself

so do not say that word
not the one we both heard too much
you may think you do but you dont
it just the fear of being alone
