crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal
fear is how i fall
confusing what is real

there something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
consuming confusing
this lack of selfcontrol i fear is never ending
controlling i can not seem

to find myself again
my walls are closing in
without a sense of confidence and i am convinced that there just too much pressure to take
i have felt this way before
so insecure

discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
distracting reacting
against my will i stand beside my own reflection
it haunting how i can not seem

there something inside me that pulls beneath the surface consuming
confusing what is real
this lack of selfcontrol i fear is never ending controlling
confusing what is real
