there something underneath your bed
pull the sheets up over your head
you hear something what was that
boo

afraid of things that go bump in the night
the candle in the pumpkin is the only light
so get ready for the fright of your life yeah

baby let me sing you a scary song
put on your halloween mask and sing along
it a creature feature baby from dusk til dawn
baby let me sing you a scary song

he walks tall and carries a butcher knife
the boogieman only wants to take your life
can not kill him off he will just come right back in part two
boo

baby let me sing you a scary song
put on your halloween mask and sing along
it a creature feature baby from dusk til dawn
baby let me sing you a scary song
