girl afraid
where does his intentions lay
or does he even have any

she says
he never really looks at me
i give him every opportunity
in the room downstairs
he sat and stared
in the room downstairs
he sat and stared
i will never make that mistake again

boy afraid
prudence never pays
and everything she wants costs money

but she doesn not even like me
and i know because she said so
in the room downstairs
she sat and stared
in the room downstairs
she sat and stared
i will never make that mistake again
