your hand fits in mine
like it is made just for me
but bear this in mind
it was meant to be
and i am joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
and it all makes sense to me

i know you have never loved
the crinkles by your eyes
when you smile
you have never loved
your stomach or your thighs
the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
but i will love them endlessly

i will not let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if i do
it you
oh it is you they add up to
i am in love with you
and all these little things

you can not go to bed without a cup of tea
and maybe that the reason that you talk in your sleep
and all those conversations are the secrets that i keep
though it makes no sense to me

i know you have never loved
the sound of your voice on tape
you never want
to know how much you weigh
you still have to squeeze into your jeans
but you are perfect to me

i will not let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if it is true
it you
it you they add up to
i am in love with you
and all these little things

you will never love yourself half as much as i love you
and you will never treat yourself right darling but i want you to
if i let you know i am here for you
maybe you will love yourself like i love you oh

and i have just let these little things slip out of my mouth
cause it is you
oh it is you
it you they add up to
and i am in love with you
and all these little things

i will not let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if it is true
it you
it you they add up to
i am in love with you
and all your little things
