slept in this room together 
but now you are gone 
and it is so quiet i turn the tv on 
we lived in this room together 
remember we painted the walls 
now time doesn not stand still 
though it crawls it crawls 

and baby i am afraid to sleep 
cause if i do i will always dream of you 
dreaming always deep 
i miss you so why did i let you go 

i never realized how much i was in love with you 
til you started sleeping with some one new 
last night i dreamed again 
december and you were there 
i cried and you kissed my face 
and you still care you still care 

and baby i am afraid to sleep 
cause if i do i will always dream of you 
dreaming always deep 
i miss you so why did i let you go 
oh oh oh 
baby i am afraid of sleep 

lying alone in the darkness 
with a memory in my head 
there a big hole where my heart is 
and a lonely feeling rolling around my bed 

and baby i am afraid to sleep 
cause if i do i will always dream of you 
dreaming always deep 
i miss you so why did i let you go 
oh oh oh oh oh oh 
baby i am afraid of sleep 
oh oh oh oh oh oh 
baby i am afraid of sleep 
baby i am afraid of sleep 

we slept in this room together and now you are gone
