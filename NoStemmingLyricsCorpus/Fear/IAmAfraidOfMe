some days in more ways
i need the distraction
fire
desire
love and reaction
he must be someone
yes even me
something for nothing
some wish to see
life beyond reason
who will i be who will i be
i am afraid of me
i am afraid of me
always survive days
cut and discretion
touched in a sane way
leave no impression
he must be someone
yes even you
fool my direction
some wish to see
love without treason
who will love me who will love me
i am afraid of me
i am afraid of me
afraid to love you
i am afraid of me
i am afraid of me
