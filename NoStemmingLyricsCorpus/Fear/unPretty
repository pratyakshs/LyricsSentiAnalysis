i wish could tie you up in my shoes
make you feel unpretty too
i was told i was beautiful
but what does that mean to you
look into the mirror who inside there
the one with the long hair
same old me again today yeah

my outsides look cool
my insides are blue
everytime i think i am through
it because of you
i have tried different ways 
but it is all the same
at the end of the day 
i have myself to blame
i am just trippin

you can buy your hair if it will not grow
you can fix your nose if he says so
you can buy all the make up 
that mac can make
but if you can not look inside you
find out who am i too
be in the position to make me feel 
so damn unpretty
i will make you feel unpretty too

never insecure until i met you
now i am bein stupid
i used to be so cute to me
just a little bit skinny
why do i look to all these things 
to keep you happy
maybe get rid of you 
and then i will get back to me hey

my outsides look cool
my insides are blue
everytime i think i am through
it because of you
i have tried different ways 
but it is all the same
at the end of the day 
i have myself to blame
i am just trippin
