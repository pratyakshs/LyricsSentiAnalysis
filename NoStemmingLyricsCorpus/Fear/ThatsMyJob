i woke up cryin late at night when i was very young
i had dreamed my father had passed away and gone
my world revolved around him i couldn not lie there anymore
so i made my way down the mirrored hall
and tapped upon his door

and i said daddy i am so afraid
how will i go on with you gone that way
don not wanna cry anymore so may i stay with you
and he said that my job that what i do
everything i do is because of you
to keep you safe with me that my job you see

later we barely got along this teenage boy and he
most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
we each held for me
he wanted knowledge and learning i wanted to fly out west
i said i could make it out there if i just had the fare
i got half will you loan me the rest

and i said daddy i am so afraid
there no guarantee in the plans i have made
and if i should fail who will pay my way back home
and he said that my job that what i do
everything i do is because of you
to keep you safe with me that my job you see

every person carves his spot and fills the hole with life
and i pray someday i might light as bright as he

woke up early one bright fall day to spread the tragic news
after all my travel i settled down within a mile or two
i make my livin with words and rhymes and all this tragedy
should go into my head and out instead as bits of poetry

but i say daddy i am so afraid
how will i go on with you gone this way
how can i come up with a song to say i love you
that my job that what i do
everything i do is because of you
to keep you safe with me that my job you see
everything i do is because of you
to seep you safe with me
