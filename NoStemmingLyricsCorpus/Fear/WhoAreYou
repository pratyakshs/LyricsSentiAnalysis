i stare at my reflection in the mirror
why am i doing this to myself
losing my mind on a tiny error
i nearly left the real me on the shelf
no no no no no

don not lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving dreaming is believing
it okay not to be okay
sometimes it is hard to follow your heart
tears do not mean you are losing everybody bruising
just be true to who you are
who you are 11x]

brushing my hairâ€”do i look perfect
i forgot what to do to fit the mould yeah
the more i try the less it is working yeah
cause everything inside me screams
no no no no no

don not lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving dreaming is believing
it okay not to be okay
sometimes it is hard to follow your heart
but tears do not mean you are losing everybody bruising
there nothing wrong with who you are

yes no egos fake shows like whoa
just go and leave me alone
real talk real life good love goodnight
with a smile that my home
that my home no

no no no no no

don not lose who you are in the blur of the stars
seeing is deceiving dreaming is believing
it okay not to be okay
sometimes it is hard to follow your heart
tears do not mean you are losing everybody bruising
just be true to who you are
yeah yeah yeah
