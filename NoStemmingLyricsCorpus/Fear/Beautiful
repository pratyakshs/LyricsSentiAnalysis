don not look at me

every day is so wonderful
then suddenly it is hard to breathe
now and then i get insecure
from all the pain i am so ashamed

i am beautiful no matter what they say
words can not bring me down
i am beautiful in every single way
yes words can not bring me down oh no
so do not you bring me down today

to all your friends you are delirious
so consumed in all your doom
trying hard to fill the emptiness
the pieces gone left the puzzle undone
is that the way it is

you are beautiful no matter what they say
words can not bring you downoh no
you are beautiful in every single way
yes words can not bring you down oh no
so do not you bring me down today

no matter what we do
no matter what we do
no matter what we say
no matter what we say
we are the song inside the tune
full of beautiful mistakes

and everywhere we go
and everywhere we go
the sun will always shine
the sun will always always shine
and tomorrow we might wake on the other side

we are beautiful no matter what they say
yes words will not bring us down no no
we are beautiful in every single way
yes words can not bring us down oh no
so do not you bring me down today

oh yeah do not you bring me down today yeah ooh
don not you bring me down ooh today
