there almost nothing left
you eat my kind for breakfast
what did i expect
to come here and find anyone
find open arms to greet me
and friends to feed me
i sicken myself so much
and you eat my kind for breakfast
you eat my kind
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whenever i let my guard down whatever i was ignoring
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whatever i have been given whatever i have been
seeing myself this way
i am a monster i believe
and seeing is believing
is there no doubt left
when i wake up i poison myself
and poison leaves no appetite
i sicken myself so much
i sicken myself so
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whenever i let my guard down whatever i was ignoring
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whatever i have been given whatever i have been
did we expect these things to change
by waking up and suddenly there they are
and all i need a starting place
and nothing ever seemed so hard   
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whenever i let my guard down whatever i was ignoring
whatever i fear the most is whatever i see before me
whatever i have been given whatever i have been
