well i never once
backed down from a punch
well i would take it square on the chin
well i found out fast
a bully just that
you have got to stand up to him
so i didn not cry when i got a black eye
as bad as it hurt i just grinned
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again

scared me to death
when you took your first steps
and i would fall every time you fell down
your first day of school i cried like a fool
and i followed your school bus to town
well i didn not cry when old yeller died
at least not in front of my friends
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again

well i am a grown man
and as strong as i am
sometimes it is hard to believe
that one little girl with little blonde curls
can totally terrify me
if you were to ask
my wife would just laugh
she would say i know all about men
how when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again

well i know one day i will give you away
and i am gonna stand there and smile
and when i get home and i am all alone
well i will sit in your room for a while
well i didn not cry when old yeller died
at least not in front of my friends
but when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again
when tough little boys grow up to be dads
they turn into big babies again
