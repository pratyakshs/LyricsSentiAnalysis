i have lived a lot of different lives
been different people many times
i live my life in bitterness
and fill my heart with emptiness

and now i see i see it for the first time
there is no crime in being kind
not everyone is out to screw you over
maybe oh just maybe they just wanna get to know ya

now the time is here
baby you do not have to live your life in fear
and the sky is clear is clear of fear

don not wanna live in fear and loathing
i wanna feel like i am floating
instead of constantly exploding
in fear and loathing

got different people inside my head
i wonder which one that they like best
i am done with tryin to have it all
and endin up with not much at all

and now the time is here
baby you do not have to live your life in fear
and the sky is clear is clear of fear
of fear

don not wanna live in fear and loathing
i wanna feel like i am floating
instead of constantly exploding
in fear and loathing

and when the time comes along
and the lights run out
i know where i will belong
when they blow me out

don not wanna live in fear and loathing
i wanna feel like i am floating
instead of constantly exploding
in fear and loathing

i wanna be completely weightless
i wanna touch the edge of greatness
don not wanna be completely faithless
completely faithless

when the time comes around
when the lights will go out
when the time comes around
when the lights they go out
