i want to be rich and i want lots of money
i do not care about clever i do not care about funny
i want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds
i heard people die while they are trying to find them

and i will take my clothes off and it will be shameless
cause everyone knows that how you get famous

i will look at the sun and i will look in the mirror
i am on the right track yeah i am on to a winner

i do not know what right and what real anymore
and i do not know how i am meant to feel anymore
and when do you think it will all become clear
cause i am being taking over by the fear

life about film stars and less about mothers
it all about fast cars and cussing each other
but it doesn not matter cause i am packing plastic
and that what makes my life so fucking fantastic

and i am a weapon of massive consumption
and it is not my fault it is how i am programmed to function

forget about guns and forget ammunition
cause i am killing them all on my own little mission
now i am not a saint but i am not a sinner
now everything cool as long as i am getting thinner
