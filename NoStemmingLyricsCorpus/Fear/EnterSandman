say your prayers little one
don not forget my son
to include everyone

tuck you in warm within
keep you free from sin
till the sandman he comes

sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

something wrong shut the light
heavy thoughts tonight
and they aren not of snow white

dreams of war dreams of liars
dreams of dragon fire
and of things that will bite

sleep with one eye open
gripping your pillow tight

exit light
enter night
take my hand
off to never never land

now i lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if i die before i wake
pray the lord my soul to take

hush little baby do not say a word
and never mind that noise you heard
it just the beast under your bed
in your closet in your head

exit light
enter night
grain of sand

exit light
enter night
take my hand
we are off to never never land
