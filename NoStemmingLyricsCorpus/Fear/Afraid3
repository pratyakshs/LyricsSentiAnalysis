do you do you wanna bleed
do you do you wanna live in vain
it only life
she so afraid to kiss
and so afraid to laugh
is she runnin from her past
it only life
she so afraid of love
is so afraid of hate
what she runnin from now

do you do you wanna scream
do you do you wanna face the strange
do you do you believe
are you are you afraid of change

it only life
she so afraid of this
and so afraid to ask
she hides behind her mask
nothing ever right
she so afraid of pain
so afraid of blame
it driving her insane
so insecure
there is no cure

well she is so afraid
she so afraid of death
she so afraid afraid of life
the drama in her head
getting louder all the time
getting louder all the time
she so afraid afraid to lose
been so afraid of fame
everyday she feels the same
it driven her insane
it driven her
it drive
its

another broken pretty thing
