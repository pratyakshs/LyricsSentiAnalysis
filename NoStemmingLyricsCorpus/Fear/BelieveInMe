i am losing myself
trying to compete
with everyone else
instead of just being me
don not know where to turn
i have been stuck in this routine
i need to change my ways
instead of always being weak

i do not wanna be afraid
i wanna wake up feeling beautifultoday
and know that i am okay
cause everyone perfect in unusual ways
so you see i just wanna believe in me

la la la la la la la la

the mirror can lie
doesn not show you what inside
and it it can tell you you are full of life
it amazing what you can hide
just by putting on a smile

i am quickly finding out
i am not about to break down
not today
i guess i always knew
that i had all the strength to make it through

not gonna be afraid
i am going to wake up feeling beautifultoday
and know that i am okay
cause everyone perfect in unusual ways
so you see now now i believe in me

now i believe in me
