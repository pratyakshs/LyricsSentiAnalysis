i am a man who walks alone
and when i am walking a dark road
at night or strolling through the park

when the light begins to change
i sometimes feel a little strange
a little anxious when it is dark

fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have constant fear that somethings
always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someones
always there

have you run your fingers down
the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you are searching for the light
sometimes when you are scared
to take a look
at the corner of the room
you have sensed that somethings
watching you

have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no one there
and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you are sure theres
someone there

watching horror films the night before
debating witches and folklores
the unknown troubles on your mind
maybe your mind is playing tricks
you sense and suddenly eyes fix
on dancing shadows from behind

fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have constant fear that somethings
always near
fear of the dark fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someones
always there

when i am walking a dark road
i am a man who walks alone
