morning smiles
like the face of a newborn child
innocent unknowing
winter end
promises of a long lost friend
speaks to me of comfort
but i fear
i have nothing to give
i have so much to lose
here in this lonely place
tangled up in our embrace
there nothing i would like
better than to fall
but i fear i have nothing to give
wind in time
rapes the flower trembling on the vine
nothing yields to shelter it
from above
they say temptation will destroy our love
the never ending hunger
but i fear
i have nothing to give
i have so much to lose
here in this lonely place
tangled up in our embrace
there nothing i would like
better than to fall
but i fear
i have nothing to give
i have so much to lose
i have nothing to give
we have so much to lose
