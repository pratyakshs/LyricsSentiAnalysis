give me a reason
to stay here
cause i
don not want
to live in fear
i can not stop
the rain
but i can stop
the tears
i can fight
the fire
but i can not fight
the fear

no more
i just cant
live here
no more
i can not take it
can not take it
no more
what do we
stand for
when we all
live in fear

give me a reason
to believe
cause you dont
wanna see me leave
i can not stop
the rain
but i can stop
the tears
oh i can fight
the fire
but i can not fight
the fear

no more
i just cant
live here
no more
i can not take it
can not take it
no more
what do we
stand for
when we all
live in fear

no more
i just cant
live here
no more
i can not take it
can not take it
no more
what do we
stand for
when we all
live in fear
