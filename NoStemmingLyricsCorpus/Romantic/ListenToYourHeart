i know there something in the wake of your smile
i get a notion from the look in your eyes yeah
you have built a love but that love falls apart
your little piece of heaven turns too dark

listen to your heart
when he is calling for you
listen to your heart
there nothing else you can do
i don not know where you are going
and i don not know why
but listen to your heart
before you tell him goodbye

sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
the precious moments are all lost in the tide yea
they are swept away and nothing is what is seems
the feeling of belonging to your dreams


and there are voices
that want to be heard
so much to mention
but you can not find the words
the scent of magic
the beauty that been
when love was wilder than the wind
