once all alone
i was lost in a world of strangers
no one to trust
on my own i was lonely
you suddenly appeared
it was cloudy before but now it’s clear
you took away the fear
you brought me back to life
you are the sun
you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night
you are the moon
that glows in my heart
you’re my daytime my night time
my world
you’re my life

now i wake up everyday
with this smile upon my face
no more tears no more pain
‘cause you love me
you help me understand
that love is the answer to all that i am
and i’m a better man
you taught me by sharing your live


you gave me strength
when i wasn’t strong
you gave me hope when all hope is lost
you opened my eyes when i couldn’t see
love was always here waiting for me
