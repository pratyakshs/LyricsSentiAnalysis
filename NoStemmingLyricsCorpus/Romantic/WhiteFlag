i know you think that i shouldn not still love you
or tell you that
but if i didn not say it well i would still have felt it 
where the sense in that

i promise i am not trying to make your life harder 
or return to where we were 

i will go down with this ship 
and i won not put my hands up and surrender 
there will be no white flag above my door 
i am in love and always will be 

i know i left too much mess and 
destruction to come back again 
and i caused nothing but trouble 
i understand if you can not talk to me again 
and if you live by the rules of it over 
then i am sure that that makes sense 

i will go down with this ship 
and i won not put my hands up and surrender 
there will be no white flag above my door 
i am in love and always will be 

and when we meet 
which i am sure we will 
all that was there
will be there still 
i will let it pass 
and hold my tongue 
and you will think 
that i have moved on

i will go down with this ship 
and i won not put my hands up and surrender 
there will be no white flag above my door 
i am in love and always will be 

i will go down with this ship 
and i won not put my hands up and surrender 
there will be no white flag above my door 
i am in love and always will be 

i will go down with this ship 
and i won not put my hands up and surrender 
there will be no white flag above my door 
i am in love and always will be
