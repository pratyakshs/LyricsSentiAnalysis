i believe the children are our are future 
teach them well and let them lead the way 
show them all the beauty they possess inside 
give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
let the children laughter remind us how we used to be 
everybody searching for a hero 
people need someone to look up to 
i never found anyone who fulfill my needs 
a lonely place to be 
so i learned to depend on me 

i decided long ago never to walk in anyone shadows 
if i fail if i succeed 
at least i will live as i believe 
no matter what they take from me 
they can not take away my dignity 
because the greatest love of all 
is happening to me 
i found the greatest love of al
inside of me 
the greatest love of all 
is easy to achieve 
learning to love yourself 
it is the greatest love of all 

i believe the children are our future 
teach them well and let them lead the way 
show them all the beauty they possess inside 
give them a sense of pride to make it easier 
let the children laughter remind us how we used to be 


and if by chance that special place 
that you have been dreaming of 
leads you to a lonely place 
find your strength in love
