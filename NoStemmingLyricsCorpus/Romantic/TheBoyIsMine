brandy excuse me can i please talk to you for a minute
monica uh huh sure you know you look kinda familiar
brandy yeah you do too but umm
i just wanted to know do you know
somebody named you
you know his name
monica  oh yeah definitely i know his name
brandy  i just wanted to let you know he is mine
monica  huhno no he is mine

you need to give it up
had about enough
it not hard to see
the boy is mine

brandy  i think it is time we got this straight
let sit and talk face to face
there is no way you could mistake him for your man
are you insane
monica  see i know that you may be
just a bit jealous of me
cause you are blind if you can not see
that his love is all in me
brandy  see i tried to hesitate
i didn not want to say what he told me
he said without me
he couldn not make it through the day
ain not that a shame
monica  and maybe you misunderstood
plus i can not see how he could
wanna take his time and that all good
all of my love was all it took

the boy is mine
you need to give it up
had about enough
it not hard to see
the boy is mine
i am sorry that you
seem to be confused
he belongs to me
the boy is mine
monica  must you do the things you do
keep on acting like a fool
you need to know it is me not you
and if you didn not know it girl it is true
brandy  i think that you should realize
and try to understand why
he is a part of my life
i know it is killing you inside
monica  you can say what you wanna say
what we have you can not take
from the truth you can not escape
i can tell the real from the fake
brandy  when will you get the picture
you are the past i am the future
get away it is my time to shine
if you didn not know the boy is mine


monica  you can not destroy this love i have found
your silly games i will not allow
the boy is mine without a doubt
you might as well throw in the towel
brandy  what makes you think that he wants you
when i am the one that brought him to
the special place that in my heart
he was my love right from the start


brandy he belongs to me sung in chorus
monica the boy is mine not yours after chorus
brandy but mine
monica not yours
brandy but mine
monica not yours
brandy but mine
i am sorry that you
seem to be confused
he belongs to me
the boy is mine
