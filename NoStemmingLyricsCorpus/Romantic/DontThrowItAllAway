maybe i do not wanna know the reason why
but lately you do not talk to me 
and baby i can not see me in your eyes

i hold you near but you are so far away
and it is losing you i can not believe
to watch you leave and let this feeling die

you alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
and tomorrow if i am here without your love you know i cant
survive
only my love can raise you high above it all

don not throw it all away our love our love
don not throw it all away our love

don not throw it all away x2]

we can take the darkness and make it full of light
let your love flow back to me 
how can you leave and let this feeling die

this happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone
and i will not even have your shoulders for the crying on
no other man love could be as true i am beggin you


you alone are the living thing that keeps me alive
and tomorrow if i am here without you love you know i cant
survive
only my love can raise you high above it all

so highabove it all
don not throw it all away our love our love
don not throw it all away our love 
so highabove it all
don not throw it all away our love our love
don not throw it all away our love

don not throw it all away our love our love
don not throw it all away our love
