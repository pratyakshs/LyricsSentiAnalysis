it a little bit funny this feeling inside
but im i am not one of those who can easily hide
i i don not have much money but boy if i did
i would buy a big house where we both could live

if i was a sculptor but but then again no
or a man who makes potions in a traveling shows
i know it is not much but it is the best i can do
my gift is my song and this one for you

and you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it is done
i hope you don not mind i hope you don not mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you are in the world

i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
well a few of the verses well they have got me quite cross
but the sun been kind while i wrote this song
it for people like you that keep it turned on

so excuse me forgetting but these things i do
you see i have forgotten if they are green or they are blue
anyway the thing is what i really mean
yours are the sweetest eyes i have ever seen

so you can tell everybody this is your song
it may be quite simple but now that it is done
i hope you don not mind i hope you don not mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you are in the world

i hope you don not mind i hope you don not mind
that i put down in words
how wonderful life is while you are in the world
