you walked into the party
like you were walking onto a yacht
your hat strategically dipped below one eye
your scarf it was apricot
you had one eye in the mirror
as you watched yourself gavotte
and all the girls dreamed that they would be your partner
they would be your partner and

you are so vain
you probably think this song is about you
you are so vain
i will bet you think this song is about you
don not you do not you

you had me several years ago
when i was still quite naive
well you said that we made such a pretty pair
and that you would never leave
but you gave away the things you loved
and one of them was me
i had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
clouds in my coffee and

you are so vain
you probably think this song is about you
you are so vain
i will bet you think this song is about you
don not you do not you 

i had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee
clouds in my coffee and

you are so vain
you probably think this song is about you
you are so vain
i will bet you think this song is about you
don not you do not you

well i hear you went up to saratoga
and your horse naturally won
then you flew your lear jet up to nova scotia
to see the total eclipse of the sun
well you are where you should be all the time
and when you are not you are with
some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend
wife of a close friend and

you are so vain
you probably think this song is about you
you are so vain
i will bet you think this song is about you
don not you do not you
