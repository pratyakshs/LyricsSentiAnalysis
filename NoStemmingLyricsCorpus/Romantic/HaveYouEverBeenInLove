have you ever been in love
you could touch the moonlight
when your heart is shooting stars
you are holding heaven in your arms
have you ever been in love

have you ever walked on air ever
felt like you were dreamin
when you never thought it could
but it really feels that good
have you ever been in love

have you ever been in love
you could touch the moonlight
when your heart is shooting stars
you are holding heaven in your arms
have you ever been in love

the time i spent waiting for something
that was heaven sent
when you find it do not let go
i know

have you ever said a prayer
and found that it was answered
all my hope has been restored
i is not looking anymore
have you ever been

some place that you is not leavin
somewhere you gonna stay
when you finally found the meanin
have you ever felt this way

the time i spent waiting for something
that was heaven sent
when you find it do not let go
i know

have you ever been in love
you could touch the moonlight
you can even reach the stars
doesn not matter near or far
have you ever been in love
have you ever been in love
so in love
