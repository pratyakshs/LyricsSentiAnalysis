what wrong with the world mama
people livin like they is not got no mamas
i think the whole world addicted to the drama
only attracted to things that will bring you trauma
overseas yeah we try to stop terrorism
but we still got terrorists here livin
in the usa the big cia
the bloods and the crips and the kkk
but if you only have love for your own race
then you only leave space to discriminate
and to discriminate only generates hate
and when you hate then you are bound to get irate
madness is what you demonstrate
and that exactly how anger works and operates
man you gotta have love just to set it straight
take control of your mind and meditate
let your soul gravitate to the love

people killin people dyin
children hurt and you hear them cryin
can you practice what you preach
and would you turn the other cheek

father father father help us
send some guidance from above
cause people got me got me questionin
where is the love

where is the love
where is the love
where is the love the love the love

it just is not the same always unchanged
new days are strange is the world insane
if love and peace is so strong
why are there pieces of love that do not belong
nations droppin bombs
chemical gasses fillin lungs of little ones
with ongoin sufferin as the youth die young
so ask yourself is the lovin really gone
so i could ask myself really what is goin wrong
in this world that we livin in people keep on givin in

makin wrong decisions only visions of them dividends
not respectin each other deny thy brother
a war is goin on but the reason undercover
the truth is kept secret it is swept under the rug
if you never know truth then you never know love
where the love yall come on
where the truth yall come on
where the love yall

i feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
as i am gettin older yall people gets colder
most of us only care about money makin
selfishness got us followin our wrong direction
wrong information always shown by the media
negative images is the main criteria
infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
yo whatever happened to the values of humanity
whatever happened to the fairness in equality
instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
lack of understanding leading lives away from unity
that the reason why sometimes i am feelin under
that the reason why sometimes i am feelin down
there no wonder why sometimes i am feelin under
gotta keep my faith alive till love is found

now ask yourself
where is the love
