it three oclock in the morning
or maybe it is four
i am thinking of you
wondering what i should i do
but i am finally cutting through this haze

it four oclock in the morning
or maybe it is five
i think i am alive
and i think i will survive
i am finally cutting through this haze of love
haze of love
for days and days and days
i am in a haze of love 

yeah you do not love me like i love you
all though you pretend
i can see this will end
i am finally cutting through this haze of love
haze of love
for days and days and days
i am in a haze of love 

it five oclock in the morning
or maybe it is six
i am sick of your lies
i am sick of your tricks
i am finally cutting through this haze of love
haze of love
for days and days and days
for days and days and days
for days and days and days
i am in a haze of love
