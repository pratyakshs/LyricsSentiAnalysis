what am i going to get you girl
i wanna buy you the whole wide world
all i got is a letter jacket and a mood ring

sometimes i see you standing in the hall
and i can not say a thing at all
deep inside i am writing you poetry

yes i am

i almost love you
i can almost feel your kiss
almost promise my heart
but my promise is more like a wish
oh i don not know what all this means
but girl i can not get you out of my dreams
everytime that we get close
it almost

yesterday i saw you on the hood of a car
with an older guy he was playing his guitar
you gave him your smile i could have cried but i just froze

should i stand up to him
should i pick a fight
should i get you to run away with me tonight

i don not know how to get there
or where we would go
don not you know

i almost love you
i can almost feel your kiss
almost promise my heart
but my promise is more like a wish
oh i don not know what all this means
but girl i can not get you out of my dreams
everytime that we get close
it almost

love it is almost the right stuff
it almost the flight of a pure white dove
it almost true love

i almost love you
i can almost feel your kiss
almost promise my heart
but my promise is more like a wish
oh i don not know what all this means
but girl i can not get you out of my dreams
everytime that we get close
it almost

love it is almost the right stuff
it almost the flight of a pure white dove
it almost true love

it almost true love
it almost the right stuff
it almost the flight of a pure white dove
it almost true love yeah
