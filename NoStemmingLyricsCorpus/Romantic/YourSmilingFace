whenever i see your smiling face
i have to smile myself 
because i love you yes i do
and when you give me that pretty little pout
it turns me inside out
there something about you baby i do not know

chorus
isn not it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
i will grow stronger every day
oh how much longer

i thought i was in love
a couple of times before
with the girl next door
but that was long before i met you
now i am sure that i will not forget you
and i thank my lucky stars
that you are who you are
and not just another lovely lady
sent down to break my heart

isn not it amazing a man like me
can feel this way
tell me how much longer
i can grow stronger every day
how much longer

no one can tell me that i am doing it wrong today
whenever i see you smile at me
no one can tell me that i am doing it wrong today
whenever i see your smile at face my way
no one can tell me that i am doing it wrong today
no one can tell me that i am doing it wrong today
