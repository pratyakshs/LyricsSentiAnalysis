loving you was easy
thought you would never leave me
yeah yeah

wrapped around my finger
see ya when i see ya
yeah yeah

now i am hearing around
that you been running around

i didn not think i would miss you
now i am feeling like a fool
ooh ohh


it hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
i thought i would never want you back
but i do not wanna live in a world with without you

i do not wanna live in a world with without you


never really noticed
all the little things you did
you did

never bought you roses
always was around my friends
my friends

and now i am hearing around
that you been running around

i didn not think i would miss you
now i am feeling like a fool
ooh ohh


it hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
i thought i would never want you back
but i do not wanna live in a world with without you

i do not wanna live in a world with without you


never should have let you slip away
living in a world that turned to grey
little did i know it hurt so bad
cause it hit me like a heart attack


it hit me like a heart attack
when you finally left me girl
i thought i would never want you back
but i do not wanna live in a world with without you

i do not wanna live in a world with without you

no oh


now i am hearing around
that you been running around

i didn not think i would miss you
now i am feeling like a fool
ooh ohh
