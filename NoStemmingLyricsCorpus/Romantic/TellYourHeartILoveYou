you lift me to the sky
when i am flat on the ground
you put me on a high
when i am all the way down
and when trouble comes around
trying to blow up the spot
you look it in the eye and say i think not

tell your heart i love you 
i love you yes i do
tell your heart i need you
you need to know its true
don not nobody in the world love you like i do 

you make me feel like a trillion bucks
when i do not even have a dime
you put a smile on my face
in a time i could be crying
and when negative comes around
with nothing good to say
you give it a stare that makes it get the hell away

tell your heart i love you 
i love you yes i do
tell your heart i need you
you need to know its true
don not nobody in the world love you like i do

long before my mind believed
my heart could not help but conceive
that i love you yeah
and when my heart did suggest
my heart had already confessed
that i love you love you love you

tell your heart i love you 
i love you yes i do
tell your heart i need you
you need to know its true
don not nobody in the world love you like i do
