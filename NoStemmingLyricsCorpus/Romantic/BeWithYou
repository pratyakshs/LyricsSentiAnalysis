monday night and i feel so low
count the hours they go so slow
i know the sound of your voice
can save my soul

city lights streets of gold
look out my window to the world below
moves so fast and it feels so cold
and i am all alone

don not let me die
i am losing my mind
baby just give me a sign

and now that you are gone
i just wanna be with you
and i can not go on
i wanna be with you
wanna be with you

i can not sleep i am up all night
through these tears i try to smile
i know the touch of your hand
can save my life

don not let me down
come to me now
i got to be with you some how

and now that you are gone
i just wanna be with you
and i can not go on
i wanna be with you
wanna be with you

don not let me down
come to me now

i got to be with you somehow
and now that you are gone
who am i without you now
i can not go on
i just wanna be with you

and now that you are gone
i just wanna be with you
and i can not go on
i wanna be with you
wanna be with you

just wanna be with you
and i can not go on
i wanna be with you

just wanna be with you
just wanna be with you

just wanna be with you
just wanna be with you
