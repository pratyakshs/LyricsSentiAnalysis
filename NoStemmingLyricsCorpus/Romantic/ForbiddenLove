love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
rejection love without doubt

spoken twice in background during first and second verses]
don not go near the fire don not go in the dark
don not give in to your desire cause he is gonna break your
heart
let go let go

i dont don not care if it is not right
to have your arms around me
i want to feel what it is like
take all of you inside of me

in your eyes in your eyes forbidden love
in your smile in your smile forbidden love
in your kiss in your kiss forbidden love
if i had one wish love would feel like this love would feel
like this

i know that you are no good for me
that why i feel i must confess
what wrong is why it feels so right
i want to feel your sweet caress


if i only had one wish
love would always feel like this
wishin on the stars above
forbidden love
if i only had one dream
this would be more than it seems
forbidden love forbidden love

love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
rejection love without doubt
is the greatest aphrodisiac


love without guilt love without doubt
love should always feel like this
heaven forgive me never forbid me
