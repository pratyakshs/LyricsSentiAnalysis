did you ever love somebody 
so much that the earth moved 
did you ever love somebody 
even though it hurt to 
did you ever love somebody 
nothing else your heart could do 
did you ever love somebody 
who never knew 
did you ever lay your head down 
on the shoulder of a good friend 
and then had to look away somehow 
had to hide the way you felt for them 
have you ever prayed the day would come 
you would hear them say they feel it too 
did you ever love someone 
who never knew 
i do 
and if you did 
well you know i would understand 
i could i would 
more than anybody can 
did you ever love somebody 
so much that the earth moved 
did you ever love somebody 
even though it hurt to 
did you ever love somebody 
nothing else your heart could do 
did you ever love somebody 
like i love you 
like i love you 
like i love you
