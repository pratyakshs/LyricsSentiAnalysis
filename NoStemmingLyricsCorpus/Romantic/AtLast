at last 

my love has come along 

my lonely days are over

and life is like a song

at last

the skies above are blue

my heart was wrapped up in clover

the night i looked at you

i found a dream that i could speak to

a dream that i can call my own

i found a thrill to press my cheek to 

a thrill that i have never known

oh you smiled  

you smiled and then the spell was cast 

now here we are in heaven

for you are mine at last
