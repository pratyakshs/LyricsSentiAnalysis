you are my destiny
you share my reverie
you are my happiness
that what you are

you have my sweet caress
you share my loneliness
you are my dream come true
that what you are

heaven and heaven alone
can take your love from me
cause i would be a fool
to ever leave you dear
and a fool i would never be

you are my destiny
you share my reverie
you are more than life to me
that what you are

you are my destiny
you share my reverie
you are my happiness
that what you are
