i saw the news today
a teenage boy blown away
another mother lost her only son

he learned his way at school
fighting is the golden rule
for twenty dollars you can own a gun

i saw the words in red
someone painted love is dead
on the sign above the football field

i had to turn away
it hurts my soul to think that way
when love is what real

cause i believe in
i believe in love
and i believe in
the miracles in us

and no matter what they say
they can never take away
what i believe in
i believe in love

in 1942
a demon army trampled through
every inch of her forgotten town

the family hid away
a secret place above decay
and there they lived and breathed
without a sound

she learned to write that year
of every scream she would dare not hear
and every tortured soul
she one day moved

one day the soldiers came
and marched her family to the train
and left her diary right in the street
and it read

i believe in
i believe in love
i believe in
the miracles in us

and no matter what they say
they can never take away
what i believe in
oh i believe in

why is it that we can not help but look for
a crack of light in the darkest sky
when will we come to understand
that through right and wrong
love the only thing that real

so here we go again
fighting til the bitter end
better off to go our seperate ways

and as you slam the door
i swear that i will love no more
but you can not believe a word i say
and that right

cause i believe in
i believe in love
and i believe in
the miracles in us
and no matter what i say
they can never take away
what i believe in
oh i believe in

i believe in yeah
i believe in love
i believe in oh
the miracles in us

and no matter what they say
they can never take away
what i believe in
oh i believe in love

i believe in love
love the only thing that real
i believe in love and the miracles in all of us
love the only thing that real
i believe in love and the miracles in all of us
