my friends wonder why i call you all of the time
what can i say
i do not feel the need to give such secrets away
you think maybe i need help no i know that i am right
i am just better off not listening to friends advice

when they insist on knowing my bliss
i tell them this
when they want to know what the reason is
i only smile when i lie then i tell them why

because your kiss your kiss is on my list
because your kiss your kiss is on my list
because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
because your kiss your kiss is on my list
because your kiss your kiss i can not resist
because your kiss is what i miss when i turn out the light

i go crazy wondering what there is to really see
did the night just take up your time cause it means more to me
sometimes i forget what i am doing i do not forget what i want
regret what i have done regret you i couldn not go on

and if you insist on knowing my bliss
i will tell you this
if you want to know what the reason is
i will only smile when i lie then i will tell you this
