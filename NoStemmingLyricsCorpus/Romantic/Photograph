look at this photograph
everytime i do it makes me laugh
how did our eyes get so red
and what the hell is on joey head

and this is where i grew up
i think the present owner fixed it up
i never knew we would ever went without
the second floor is hard for sneaking out

and this is where i went to school
most of the time had better things to do
criminal record says i broke in twice
i must have done it half a dozen times

i wonder if it is too late
should i go back and try to graduate
life better now then it was back then
if i was them i would not let me in

oh oh oh
oh god i

every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

remember the old arcade
blew every dollar that we ever made
the cops hated us hangin out
they say somebody went and burned it down

we used to listen to the radio
and sing along with every song we know
we said someday we would find out how if feels
to sing to more than just the steering wheel

kim the first girl i kissed
i was so nervous that i nearly missed
she had a couple of kids since then
i haven not seen her since god knows when

oh oh oh
oh god i

every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

i miss that town
i miss the faces
you can not erase
you can not replace it
i miss it now
i can not believe it

so hard to stay
too hard to leave it

if i could i relive those days
i know the one thing that would never change

every memory of looking out the back door
i had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

every memory of walking out the front door
i found the photo of the friend that i was looking for
it hard to say it time to say it
goodbye goodbye

look at this photograph
everytime i do it makes me laugh
everytime i do it makes me
