head under water
and they tell me to breathe easy for a while
the breathing gets harder even i know that
made room for me but it is too soon to see
if i am happy in your hands
i am unusually hard to hold on to

blank stares at blank pages
no easy way to say this
you mean well but you make this hard on me

i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it is make or break in this
if you are on your way
i am not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leaving ima need a better reason to write you a love song today today

i learned the hard way
that they all say things you want to hear
and my heavy heart sinks deep down under you and your twisted words
your help just hurts
you are not what i thought you were
hello to high and dry

convinced me to please you
made me think that i need this too
i am trying to let you hear me as i am

i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it is make or break in this
if you are on your way
i am not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leaving ima need a better reason to write you a love song today

promise me that you will leave the light on
to help me see with daylight my guide gone
cause i believe there a way you can love me
because i say

i will not write you a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it is make or break in this

is that why you wanted a love song
cause you asked for it
cause you need one you see
i am not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me it is make or break in this
if you are on your way
i am not gonna write you to stay
if your heart is nowhere in it
i do not want it for a minute
babe i will walk the seven seas when i believe that there a reason to write you a love song today today
