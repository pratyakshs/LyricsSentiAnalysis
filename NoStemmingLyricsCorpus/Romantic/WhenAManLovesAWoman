when a man loves a woman 
can not keep his mind on nothing else 
he will change the world
for the good thing he is found 
if she is bad he can not see it 
he can do her no wrong
turn his back on his best friend 
if he put her down 

when a man loves a woman 
spend his very last dime 
tryin to hold on to what he needs 
he would give up all his comfort 
sleep out in the rain 
if she said that the way it ought to be

well this man loves a woman 
i gave you everything i had 
trying to hold on to your highclass love
baby please do not treat me bad 

when a man loves a woman 
down deep in his soul 
she can bring him such misery 
if she plays him for a fool 
he the last one to know 
lovin eyes can not ever see 

when a man loves a woman 
he can do no wrong 
he can never want some other girl
yes when a man loves a woman 
i know exactly how he feels 
cause baby baby baby you are my world 

when a man loves a woman
