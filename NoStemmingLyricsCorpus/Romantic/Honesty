if you search for tenderness
it isn not hard to find
you can have the love you need to live
but if you look for truthfulness
you might just as well be blind
it always seems to be so hard to give

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you

i can always find someone
to say they sympathize
if i wear my heart out on my sleeve
but i don not want some pretty face
to tell me pretty lies
all i want is someone to believe

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you

i can find a lover
i can find a friend
i can have security until the bitter end
anyone can comfort me
with promises again
i know i know

when i am deep inside of me
don not be too concerned
i won not ask for nothin while i am gone
but when i want sincerity
tell me where else can i turn
because you are the one i depend upon

honesty is such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty is hardly ever heard
and mostly what i need from you
