on a monday i am waiting
tuesday i am fading
and by wednesday i can not sleep
then the phone rings i hear you
and the darkness is a clear view
cuz you have come to rescue me

fall with you i fall so fast
i can hardly catch my breath i hope it lasts

ohhhhh
it seems like i can finally rest my head on something real
i like the way that feels
ohhhhh
it as if you know me better than i ever knew myself
i love how you can tell
all the pieces pieces pieces of me
all the pieces pieces pieces of me

i am moody messy
i get restless and it is senseless
how you never seem to care

when i am angry you listen
make me happy it is a mission

and you will not stop til i am there
fall sometimes i fall so fast
when i hit that bottom
crash you are all i have

ohhhhh
it seems like i can finally rest my head on something real
i like the way that feels
ohhhhh
it as if you known me better than i ever knew myself
i love how you can tell
all the pieces pieces pieces of me

how do you know everything i am about to say
am i that obvious
and if it is written on my face
i hope it never goes away yeah

on a monday i am waiting
and by tuesday i am fading into your arms
so i can breathe

ohhhhh
it seems like i can finally rest my head on something real
i like the way that feels
ohhhhh
it as if you have know me better than i ever knew myself
i love how you can tell
ohhhhh
i love how you can tell
ohhhhh
i love how you can tell
all the pieces pieces pieces of me
all the pieces pieces pieces of me
