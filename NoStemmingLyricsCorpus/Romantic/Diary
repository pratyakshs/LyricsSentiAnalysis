lay your head on my pillow
here you can be yourself
no one has to know what you are feelin
no one but me and you

i wont tell your secrets
your secrets are safe with me
i will keep your secrets
just think of me as the pages in your diary

i feel such a connection
even when you are far away
oooh baby if there is anything that you fear 
call 489 4608 and i will be here

i will not tell your secrets
your secrets are safe with me
i will keep your secrets
just think of me as the pages in your diary

only we know what is talked about baby boy
don not know how you could be driving me so crazy
when you are in town
why do not you come around 
i will be the loyalty you need
you can trust me
