i am so tired of being here
suppressed by all my childish fears
and if you have to leave
i wish that you would just leave
cause your presence still lingers here
and it will not leave me alone

these wounds will not seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there just too much that time cannot erase

when you cried i would wipe away all of your tears
when you would scream i would fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have
all of me

you used to captivate me
by your resonating light
now i am bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts
my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away
all the sanity in me

these wounds will not seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there just too much that time cannot erase


i have tried so hard to tell myself that you are gone
but though you are still with me
i have been alone all along
