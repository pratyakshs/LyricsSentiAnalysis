good afternoon everyone
we are flying at 26000 feet moving
up to 30000 feet and then we have got clear skies
all the way to las vegas and right now we are bringin you some in flight
entertainment one of our first class passengers has written a song
inspired by one of our coach passengers and since we let our first class
passengers do pretty much whatever they want here he is

i wanna make you smile whenever you are sad
carry you around when your arthritis is bad
all i wanna do is grow old with you

i will get your medicine when your tummy aches
build you a fire if the furnace breaks
oh it could be so nice growing old with you

i will miss you
kiss you
give you my coat when you are cold

need you
feed you
even let ya hold the remote control

so let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink
put you to bed if you have had too much to drink
i could be the man who grows old with you
i wanna grow old with you
