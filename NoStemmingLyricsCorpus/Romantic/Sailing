well it is not far down to paradise
at least it is not for me
and if the wind is right you can sail away
and find tranquility
oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
believe me

it not far to nevernever land
no reason to pretend
and if the wind is right you can find
the joy of innocence again
oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
believe me

sailing takes me away
to where i have always heard it could be
just a dream and the wind to carry me
and soon i will be free

fantasy it gets the best of me
when i am sailing
all caught up in the reverie
every word is a symphony
won not you believe me

well it is not far back to sanity
at least it is not for me
and if the wind is right you can sail away
and find serenity
oh the canvas can do miracles just you wait and see
believe me
