i believe in miracles 
i believe in signs 
and i believe that mountains move 
one prayer at a time 

if i could be an angel 
i would make your every wish come true 
but i am only human 
just a woman 
lovin you 

where your road leads 
i will follow 
when your heart bleeds 
i will be there for you 
when your night grows dark 
and you can not find your tomorrow 
then you can follow me 

someday we will look back and see 
our footprints in the sand 
sometimes you would carry me 
and sometimes you would be in my hands 

if we can love forever 
that will not be long enough for me 
i want to hold you tender 
be your shelter 
all you need 

where your road leads 
i will follow 
when your heart bleeds 
i will be there for you 
when your night grows dark 
and you can not find your tomorrow 
then you can follow me 

oh we can be each other guiding light 
through this long and winding life 

where your road leads 
i will follow 
when your heart bleeds 
i will be there for you 
when your night grows dark 
and you can not find your tomorrow 
when you have lost sight of your dreams 
then you can follow me
