in my life i see where i have been 
i said that i would never fall again 
within myself i was wrong 
my searchin is not over over 
i know that 

when you love a woman 
you see your world inside her eyes 
when you love a woman 
you know she is standin by your side 
a joy that lasts forever 
there a band of gold that shines waiting 
somewhere oh yeah 

if i can not believe that someone is true 
to fall in love is so hard to do 
i hope and pray tonight 
somewhere you are thinking of me girl 
yes i know i know that 

when you love a woman 
you see your world inside her eyes 
when you love a woman 
you know she is standin by your side 
a joy that lasts forever 
there a band of gold that shines waiting 
somewhere oh 

it enough to make you cry 
when you see her walkin by 
and you look into her eyes 

when you love a woman 
you see your world inside her eyes 
when you love a woman 
well you know she is standin by your side 
a joy that lasts forever 

there a band of gold that shines 
when you love a woman 
when you love love love 
when you love a woman 
you see your world inside her eyes
