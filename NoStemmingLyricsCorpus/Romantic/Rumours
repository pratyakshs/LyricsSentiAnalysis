saturdays i get into the club
and it makes me wanna tell the dj 
turn it up
i feel the energy all around
and my body can not stop moving to the sound

but i can tell that you are watching me
and you are probably gonna write what you didn not see
well i just need a little space to breathe
can you please respect my privacy

why can not you just let me 
do the things i wanna do
i just wanna be me 
i do not understand why
would you wanna bring me down
i am only having fun
i wanna live my life
like i wanna do
i am sick of being followed
i am tired of people lying
saying what they want about me
why can not they back up off me
why can not they let me live
i am gonna do it my way
take this for just what it is

here we are back up in the club
people taking pictures
don not you think they get enough
i just wanna be all over the floor
and throw my hands up in the air to a beat like whaaat
i have gotta say respectfully
i would like it if you take the cameras off of me
cause i just want a little room to breathe
please respect my privacy


why can not you just let me 
do the things i wanna do
i just wanna be me
i do not understand why
would you wanna bring me down
i am only having fun
i wanna live my life
like i wanna do 


i am tired of rumors starting
i am sick of being followed
i am tired of people lying
saying what they want about me
why can not they back up off me
why can not they let me live
i am gonna do it my way
take this for just what it is
