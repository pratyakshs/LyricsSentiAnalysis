before anything became between us
you were like my best friend
the one i used to run and talk to
when me and my girl was having problems
you used to say it would be okay
suggest little nice things that i should do
and when i go home at night and lay my head down
all i seem to think about was you
and how you make me wanna

now what bad is you are the one that hooked us up
knowin it should have been you
and what sad is that i love her but i am falling for you
what should i do
should i tell my baby bye bye
should i do exactly what i feel inside
cause i i don not wanna go don not need to stay
but i really need to get it together
at this point the situation out of control
i never meant to hurt her
but i gotta let her go
and she may not understand it
why all of this is going on
i tried i tried to fight it
but the feeling just too strong
