here she comes ooh just like an angel
seems like forever that she is been on my mind
but nothing has changed
she thinks i am a waste of her time

there she goes
she don not know what she is missing
can not she see i will never give up the fight
i will do all i can till she understands my desire

i have been on the outside looking in
let me into your heart oh
there nothing on earth
that should keep us apart
baby

i can not live without your love and affection
i can not face another night on my own
i would give up my pride to save me from being alone
cause i can not live without your love

so i wait here for an answer
and wonder if tomorrow will be like yesterday
i will keep holding on
but i can not go on living this way
baby

i have been on the outside looking in
bring these tears to an end oh
i realize there no use for me to pretend
oh yeah


for your love
i would put my arms around you
for your love
i would find the strength to tell you
for your love
i can not live without your love
