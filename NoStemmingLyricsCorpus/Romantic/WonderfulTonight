it late in the evening she is wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her make up and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me do i look alright
and i say yes you look wonderful tonight

we go to a party and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady that walking around with me
and then she asks me do you feel alright
and i say yes i feel wonderful tonight

and i feel wonderful
because i see the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just don not realize how much i love you

it time to go home now and i have got an aching head
so i give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
and then i tell her as i turn out the light
i say my darling you were wonderful tonight
oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
