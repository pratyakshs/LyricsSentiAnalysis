let me be your hero

would you dance
if i asked you to dance
would you run
and never look back
would you cry
if you saw me crying
and would you save my soul tonight

would you tremble
if i touched your lips
would you laugh
oh please tell me this
now would you die
for the one you loved
hold me in your arms tonight

i can be your hero baby
i can kiss away the pain
i will stand by you forever
you can take my breath away

would you swear
that you will always be mine
or would you lie
would you run and hide
am i in too deep
have i lost my mind
i don not care
you are here tonight

i can be your hero baby
i can kiss away the pain
i will stand by you forever
you can take my breath away

oh i just want to hold you
i just want to hold you oh yeah
am i in too deep
have i lost my mind
well i don not care
you are here tonight

i can be your hero baby
i can kiss away the pain oh yeah
i will stand by you forever
you can take my breath away

i can be your hero
i can kiss away the pain
and i will stand by you forever
you can take my breath away
you can take my breath away

i can be your hero
