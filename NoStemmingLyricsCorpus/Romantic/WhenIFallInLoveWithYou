shattered dreams worthless years 
here am i encased inside a hollow shell 
life began then was done 
now i stare into a cold and empty well 

the many sounds that meet our ears 
the sights our eyes behold 
will open up our merging hearts 
and feed our empty souls 

i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever 
i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever 

without despair we will share 
and the joys of caring will not be replaced 
what has been must never end 
and with the strength we have will not be erased 
when the truths of love are planted firm 
they will not be hard to find 
and the words of love i speak to you 
will echo in your mind 

i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever 
i believe when i fall in love this time it will be forever 

i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever 
i believe when i fall in love with you it will be forever 

i am so glad that i found someone to believe in again 
i am so glad that i found someone to believe in again 

god surely answered my prayer 
god surely answered by prayer 
you know god surely answered my prayer 
you know god surely answered my prayer 
god always will answer your prayers 
believe in one who will answer my prayer 
thank you god 

come on let fall in love 
you are the woman i have been waiting for 
come on let fall in love 
you are the girl that i really adore 
come on let fall in love
