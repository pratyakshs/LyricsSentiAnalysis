beatles the
revolver
here there and everywhere
to lead a better life i need my love to be here

here making each day of the year
changing my life with a wave of her hand
nobody can deny that there something there

there running my hands through her hair
both of us thinking how good it can be
someone is speaking but she doesn not know he is there

i want her everywhere
and if she is beside me i know i need never care
but to love her is to meet her everywhere
knowing that love is to share
each one believing that love never dies
watching her eyes and hoping i am always there

i want her everywhere
and if she is beside me i know i need never care
but to love her is to meet her everywhere
knowing that love is to share
each one believing that love never dies
watching her eyes and hoping i am always there

to be there and everywhere
here there and everywhere
