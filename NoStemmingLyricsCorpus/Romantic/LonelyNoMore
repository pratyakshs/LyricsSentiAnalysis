now it seems to me
that you know just what to say
words are only words
can you show me something else
can you swear to me that you will always be this way
show me how you feel
more than ever baby

i do not wanna be lonely no more
i do not wanna have to pay for this
i do not want to know the lover at my door
is just another heartache on my list

i do not wanna be angry no more
you know i could never stand for this
so when you tell me that you love me know for sure
i do not want to be lonely anymore

now its hard for me with my heart still on the mend
open up to me like you do your girlfriends
and you sing to me and it is harmony 
girl what you do to me is everything 
make me say anything just to get you back again
why can not we just try


what if i was good to you what if you were good to me
what if i could hold you till i feel you move inside of me
what if it was paradise what if we were symphonies
what if i gave all my life to find some way to stand beside you
