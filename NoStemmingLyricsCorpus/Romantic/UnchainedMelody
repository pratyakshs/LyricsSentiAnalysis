oh my love my darling
i have hungered for your touch
a long lonely time

and time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine

i need your love
i need your love
god speed your love to me

lonely rivers flow
to the sea to the sea
to the open arms of the sea

lonely rivers sigh
wait for me wait for me
i will be coming home wait for me

oh my love my darling
i have hungered hungered for your touch
a long lonely time

and time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine

i need your love
i need your love
god speed your love to me
