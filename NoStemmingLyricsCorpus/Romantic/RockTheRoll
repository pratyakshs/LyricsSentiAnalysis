every girl thinks i am so lucky
just to be with you
i know that you agree with them
but here comes the other shoe
you don not know what you have got
since you took a gamble on me
so stop messin round like you own this town
cause you won the lottery
don not think i am playin around
cause we are having too much fun to see
i am not trying to bark but our future dark
you know what i mean
i am so tired of making you cry
i think we are all okay and then i wonder why
you get so mad when i am out on my own
you like it when i am there when you come home
i just want you and everything that we got
girl you know i love you and i love you alot
but i need some peace in a world so cold
you gotta know when to rock and not to roll

you gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
you gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
you gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
you gotta know when to rock and rock the roll
when to rock and not to roll

yeah you are cute and sexy
but that won not take us very far
everybody pushin me to date a big rock star
but that don not matter to me
cause i am already a queen
by the way i live and to who i give
and that enough for me
so stop messin round with my heart
cause you know i love ya alot
but something gotta change
this can not stay the same
i have given all iâ€™ve got

girl i would never tell you a lie
i am not a super hero just a regular guy
i think it is time that we have some fun
can not always be worrying bout what i haven not done
i just want you and everything that we got
girl you know i love you and i love you alot
but i need some peace in a world so cold
you gotta know when to rock and not to roll

baby i am not saying it is not you i wanna hold
sometimes when it comes to you i am so emotional
but if you want me to love you every night
you have gotta learn what it will take to make this
girl feel right
