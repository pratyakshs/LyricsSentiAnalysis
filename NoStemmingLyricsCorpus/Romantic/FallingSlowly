i do not know you
but i want you all the more for that
and words fall through me
and always fool me and i can not react

and games that never amount
to more than they are meant
will play themselves out

take this sinking boat and point it home
we have still got time
raise your hopeful voice you have a choice
you have made it now

falling slowly eyes that know me
and i can not go back
moods that take me and erase me
and i am painted black

you have suffered enough
and warred with yourself
it time that you won

take this sinking boat and point it home
we have still got time
raise your hopeful voice you had a choice
you have made it now

take this sinking boat and point it home
we have still got time
raise your hopeful voice you had a choice
you have made it now

falling slowly sing your melody
i will sing along
