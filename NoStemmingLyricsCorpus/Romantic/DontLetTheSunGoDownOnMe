i can not light no more of your darkness
all my pictures seem to fade to black and white
i am growing tired and time stands still before me
frozen here on the ladder of my life

too late to save myself from falling
i took a chance and changed your way of life
but you misread my meaning when i met you
closed the door and left me blinded by the light

don not let the sun go down on me
although i search myself it is always someone else i see
i would just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
but losing everything is like the sun going down on me

i can not find oh the right romantic line
but see me once and see the way i feel
don not discard me just because you think i mean you harm
but these cuts i have they need love to help them heal
