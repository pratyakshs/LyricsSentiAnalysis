the book of love is long and boring
no one can lift the damn thing
it full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing

but i i love it when you read to me
and you you can read me anything

the book of love has music in it
in fact that where music comes from
some of it is just transcendental
some of it is just really dumb

but i i love it when you sing to me
and you you can sing me anything

the book of love is long and boring
and written very long ago
it full of flowers and heart shaped boxes
and things we are all too young to know

but i i love it when you give me things
and you you ought to give me wedding rings
i i love it when you give me things
and you you ought to give me wedding rings
