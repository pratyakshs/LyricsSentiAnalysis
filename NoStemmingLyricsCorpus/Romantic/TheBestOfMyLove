every night i am lyin in bed
holdin you close in my dreams
thinkin about all the things that we said
and comin apart at the seams

we try to talk it over
but the words come out too rough
i know you were tryin
to give me the best of your love

beautiful faces and loud empty places
look at the way that we live
wastin our time on cheap talk and wine
left us so little to give

that same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud
that we could never rise above
but here in my heart
i give you the best of my love

ooooh sweet darlin you get the best of my love
you get the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin you get the best of my love
you get the best of my love

i am goin back in time and it is a sweet dream
it was a quiet night and i would be all right
if i could go on sleeping

but every mornin i wake up and worry
what gonna happen today
you see it your way and i see it mine
but we both see it slippin away

you know we always had each other baby
i guess that wasn not enough
oh but here in my heart
i give you the best of my love

ooooh sweet darlin
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin every night and day
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin oooooooo oooh
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin you get the best of my love
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin mmmmmmmmmmmm
you get the best of my love the best of my love
ooooh sweet darlin you got it you got it
you get the best of my love
the best of my love
