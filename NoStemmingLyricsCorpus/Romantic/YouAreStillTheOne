looks like we made it
look how far we have come my baby
we mighta took the long way
we knew we would get there someday

they said i bet they will never make it
but just look at us holding on
we are still together still going strong

you are still the one
you are still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you are still the one i want for life
you are still the one
you are still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you are still the one i kiss good night

ain not nothin better
we beat the odds together
i am glad we didn not listen
look at what we would be missin

they said i bet they will never make it
but just look at us holding on
we are still together still going strong

you are still the one
you are still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you are still the one i want for life
you are still the one
you are still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you are still the one i kiss good night

you are still the one
you are still the one i run to
the one that i belong to
you are still the one i want for life
you are still the one
you are still the one that i love
the only one i dream of
you are still the one i kiss good night
